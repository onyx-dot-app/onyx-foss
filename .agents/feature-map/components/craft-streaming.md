# Craft Streaming

(see §9).

## 1. What the user experiences

The user sends a message and watches the agent think, call tools (bash, edit,
search, a sub-agent task), and answer, all streaming token by token into the
Craft transcript. Approvals pop up mid-turn when the agent wants to touch a
connected external app. If the tab reloads or the connection drops mid-turn,
reopening the session re-attaches to the turn already running in the
background and continues rendering it live; it does not lose the turn, but it
also does not replay, byte-for-byte, whatever the client missed while
disconnected (see §5, §9).

The Working group shows the tool-call count without a failed-count badge.
Its tool details start collapsed, including failures; users can expand each call
to read its output.

A sub-agent ("task" tool) has a separate sub-agent view (`SubagentView.tsx`).
That view shows the sub-agent's own thinking and tool calls live while the
run is active. The parent transcript shows only the task prompt and the final
answer.

## 2. Surfaces

### HTTP endpoints (router prefix `/build`, unless noted)

| Method | Path | Handler | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/sessions/{id}/send-message` | `messages.py:send_message` | Starts a turn and returns immediately with an `InteractiveTurnResponse` (a `turn_id`). Does **not** stream. |
| GET | `/sessions/{id}/turns/active` | `interactive_turns/api.py:get_active_interactive_turn` | Poll target: is a turn currently running for this session. |
| GET | `/sessions/{id}/turns/{turn_id}/events` | `interactive_turns/api.py:get_interactive_turn_events` | **The stream.** NDJSON-free SSE (`text/event-stream`), `event: message` records. Attach-only: does not start a turn, only follows one that `send-message` already created. |
| POST | `/sessions/{id}/subagents/{subagent_session_id}/send-message` | `messages.py:send_subagent_message` | Sends a follow-up prompt directly into a running sub-agent's opencode session. |
| POST | `/sessions/{id}/interrupt` | `messages.py:interrupt_message` | Sets the interrupt fence the runner polls (see §4.3). |
| GET | `/sessions/{id}/scheduled-run-events` | `session/api.py:get_session_scheduled_run_events` | Same wire format, for watching a Celery-driven scheduled run instead of an interactive turn. |

`get_interactive_turn_events` is the sole owner of turning a running turn into
bytes for one browser tab. Two tabs open on the same turn each get their own
subscriber queue off the same `PodEventBus` (§4.2); neither is authoritative.

### Environment configuration (`backend/onyx/server/features/build/configs.py`, `timeouts.py`)

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SSE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL` | 15s | Cadence of `SSEKeepalive` markers on every stream in this component. |
| `OPENCODE_PROMPT_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | derived from `SANDBOX_APPROVAL_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Renewed by turn activity. It aborts a silent prompt step after this long. The runner re-prompts up to `MAX_TIMEOUT_CONTINUATIONS` (2) times before it fails the turn (`interactive_turns/executor.py`). |
| `OPENCODE_SERVE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` / `_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` / `_EVENT_READ_TIMEOUT` | 5s / 30s / 60s | HTTP timeouts from the API server to the in-pod `opencode serve` process. |
| `OPENCODE_SERVE_SESSION_INIT_TIMEOUT` | 90s | HTTP read/write timeout for `ensure_session` lookup and creation, which can initialize a cold directory. Ordinary requests use 30s. |
| `SANDBOX_APPROVAL_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 180s | How long a turn waits on an unanswered approval before it times out. |
| `RUNNER_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` (`timeouts.py`) | `6 * SSE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL` | A `RUNNING` turn with no heartbeat this long is reclaimable by a new runner. |
| `INTERACTIVE_TURN_HARD_CAP_SECONDS` (`timeouts.py`) | 30 min | Hard wall-clock budget for one turn (`run_claimed_interactive_build_turn`). |
| `ACTIVE_TURN_TTL_SECONDS` (`timeouts.py`) | hard cap + reclaim slack | TTL of the turn's cache record. |

## 3. Data model

Like [[streaming-protocol]], packets themselves are never written to
Postgres as a stream; what gets written is either the *result* or, for a few
packet families, the packet itself as a `BuildMessage.message_metadata` blob.
This component does not own the `BuildMessage`/`BuildSession` tables
([[craft-sessions]] does), but it is the sole writer of the streaming rows on
them:

- `persist_sandbox_event` (`session/streaming.py:persist_sandbox_event`)
  accumulates `AgentMessageChunk`/`AgentThoughtChunk` text and flushes it as
  one `BuildMessage` row per `agent_message`/`agent_thought` block. It persists
  `ToolCallProgress` only on `status in ("completed", "failed")` (and every
  update for `todowrite`), and upserts `AgentPlanUpdate` in place
  (`upsert_agent_plan`). `ToolCallStart`, `CurrentModeUpdate`, `PromptResponse`,
  and unrecognized types are **not persisted**.
- A completed `task` tool call (a sub-agent) additionally persists a synthetic
  `agent_message` row (`source: "task_output"`) so the sub-agent's final answer
  shows up in the parent transcript even though its live activity was not
  captured (`session/streaming.py:persist_sandbox_event`, the `is_task_tool`
  branch).

**The turn itself is cache-backed, not a DB row**, unlike chat's
`ChatMessage`/processing-fence split:

- `InteractiveTurn` (`interactive_turns/state.py:InteractiveTurn`) lives in
  `CacheBackend` under a `turn_id` key, TTL `ACTIVE_TURN_TTL_SECONDS`. It
  carries `status` (`QUEUED`/`RUNNING`/`SUCCEEDED`/`FAILED`/`CANCELLED`),
  `runner_id`, and `last_heartbeat_at`.
- A session-scoped "active turn" pointer and a lock
  (`_active_turn_key`, `_active_turn_lock_key`) enforce one live turn per
  session.
- There is **no packet-level durable buffer** analogous to chat's
  `stream_buffer.py`. See §5.9.

---

## 4. How it works

### 4.1 The path from agent process to browser

```
opencode serve (in-pod)              GET /event (raw SSE from opencode)
  └─ PodEventBus._reader_loop         sandbox/opencode/event_bus.py
     one long-lived subscription per (sandbox_id, directory), fanned out by session_id
       └─ per-session Queue           _Subscription.queue
          ├─ OpencodeServeClient.send_message      (turn-owning path)
          │    consumes its own subscription, translates raw opencode
          │    events → SandboxEvent via translate_opencode_event
          └─ SandboxManager.subscribe_to_opencode_session
               (serve_transport.py)  same translation, for late/second attaches

translate_opencode_event() → SandboxEvent (AgentMessageChunk, ToolCallStart, …)
  │
  ├─ interactive_turns/executor.py: _drive_interactive_turn
  │    persists via persist_sandbox_event, forwards live via merge_events_with_announces
  │
  └─ interactive_turns/api.py: get_interactive_turn_events
       session_manager.subscribe_to_existing_session_events()
         → event_to_sse() → "event: message\ndata: {...}\n\n"
           → StreamingResponse(text/event-stream)
             → browser: processSSEStream() → parsePacket() → BuildMessageList
```

The turn-owning runner (`_drive_interactive_turn`) and the browser's SSE
attach are **two independent consumers of the same `PodEventBus`**, not
producer and consumer of one pipe. The runner drives the turn (posts the
prompt, persists rows, decides when the turn ends) whether or not a browser is
attached; the browser attach only subscribes to render it live. This is the
load-bearing difference from [[core-chat-loop]], where the HTTP request itself
drives the turn.

### 4.2 The opencode-serve client and the shared bus

`OpencodeServeClient` (`sandbox/opencode/serve_client.py:OpencodeServeClient`)
is an HTTP client over one `opencode serve` process per sandbox pod
(`ensure_session`, `send_message`, `get_message`, `abort`). It does not itself
own the SSE connection to opencode: that is `PodEventBus`
(`sandbox/opencode/event_bus.py:PodEventBus`), one reader per
`(sandbox_id, directory)` (the opencode `/event` stream is scoped by `?directory=`) that
opens `GET {base_url}/event`, parses raw SSE blocks
(`_parse_sse_block`), and dispatches each event to every subscriber whose
`session_id` matches (`PodEventBus._dispatch`). One dead upstream connection
reconnects with exponential backoff (1s → 30s) and gives up after 20
consecutive failures, self-closing the bus (`PodEventBus._reader_loop`).

`translate_opencode_event` (`serve_client.py:translate_opencode_event`) is the
single function that turns a raw opencode JSON event into zero or more
`SandboxEvent`s. It is the load-bearing translator the three pitfalls in §5
and §9 were found in.

### 4.3 The interactive turn lifecycle

`POST /sessions/{id}/send-message` (`session/messages.py:send_message`)
creates a `BuildMessage` (the user's message), a cache-backed `InteractiveTurn`
(`interactive_turns/state.py:create_interactive_turn`), and starts a
**daemon Python thread** in this API-server process
(`interactive_turns/executor.py:start_interactive_turn_runner`). It returns the
`turn_id` immediately; it never streams.

The thread claims the turn (`claim_turn_for_runner`, a runner-id compare-and-set
so at most one runner drives a turn), wakes the sandbox if needed
(`_ready_session_runtime`), then runs `_drive_interactive_turn`, which calls
`OpencodeServeClient.send_message` and both persists
(`persist_sandbox_event`) and forwards each event.

The browser never talks to this thread directly. It calls
`GET /sessions/{id}/turns/{turn_id}/events`
(`interactive_turns/api.py:get_interactive_turn_events`), which polls
`get_active_turn`/`get_turn` until the turn is active and the sandbox is up,
then calls `SessionManager.subscribe_to_existing_session_events`
(`session/manager.py:subscribe_to_existing_session_events`), which subscribes
to the **same** `PodEventBus` by `opencode_session_id`. If the runner looks
dead (`RUNNER_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` since its last heartbeat), the attach
endpoint restarts it (`maybe_start_runner`) rather than waiting for it
forever.

`POST /sessions/{id}/interrupt` sets a fence the runner's
`interrupt_requested()` closure polls; the runner aborts the opencode turn
and finishes with `CANCELLED`.

### 4.4 The packet vocabulary

Two families of packets travel over the wire, both serialized by
`event_to_sse` (`session/streaming.py:event_to_sse`) as
`event: message\ndata: {...}\n\n` with a `type` discriminator field. **Neither
is chat's `Packet`/`Placement`.** There is no `placement` field at all; routing
within a turn is carried ad hoc per packet (`sessionId`, `parentSessionId`,
`subagentSessionId` fields handled by `_routing_meta_from_event`).

**Sandbox events** (re-exported from the `agent-client-protocol` PyPI package
through the single wrapper `sandbox/event_schema.py`, historically called
"ACP events"; see §9):

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AgentMessageChunk` (`agent_message_chunk`) | One chunk of assistant text or image content. |
| `AgentThoughtChunk` (`agent_thought_chunk`) | One chunk of the agent's reasoning. |
| `ToolCallStart` (`tool_call_start`) | A tool invocation began. Stream-only; not persisted. |
| `ToolCallProgress` (`tool_call_progress`) | Tool status/result update. Persisted on `completed`/`failed` (every update for `todowrite`). |
| `AgentPlanUpdate` (`agent_plan_update`) | The agent's todo/plan list. Upserted, one row per turn. |
| `CurrentModeUpdate` (`current_mode_update`) | Agent mode changed. |
| `PromptResponse` (`prompt_response`) | Turn ended. Terminal for the stream; carries `stopReason` (`"end_turn"`, `"cancelled"`, …). |
| `Error` (`error`) | opencode reported a turn-terminating failure. Carries a negative `code` sentinel: `TURN_ERROR_CODE_SESSION`, `_TIMEOUT`, `_TRANSPORT` (`event_schema.py`). |
| `ActivityTimeoutError` | Subtype of `Error` for a recoverable inactivity timeout (retry by re-prompting), distinguished by Python type, not `code`. |

**Onyx-defined packets** (`packets.py:BuildPacket`, a `Union`, not a
discriminated Pydantic union enforced at the type level the way chat's
`PacketObj` is):

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ErrorPacket` (`error`) | Onyx-side error (session/sandbox not found), distinct from opencode's `Error`. Shares the `"error"` string with it. |
| `ApprovalRequestedPacket` (`approval_requested`) | A new approval card exists; carries only ids, frontend refetches contents. |
| `SubagentStartedPacket` (`subagent_started`) | A child opencode session was created for a `task` tool call. |
| `ConnectAppRequestPacket` (`connect_app_request`) | The agent's `connect_app` tool wants the user to connect an org app. |
| `ContextUsagePacket` (`context_usage`) | Token/cost usage snapshot. Captured into turn state, then persisted once per turn by `finalize_persist` as a `BuildMessage`. |
| `CompactionPacket` (`compaction`) | History was compacted; carries a summary. |

`SSEKeepalive` (`sandbox/sse.py:SSEKeepalive`) is a third, transport-only
marker: it never reaches the browser as JSON, only as the literal SSE comment
`": keepalive\n\n"` (`session/streaming.py:event_to_sse`).

---

### Output inventory and panel navigation

The frontend keeps a temporary output inventory in each Zustand session.
`useBuildSessionStore.ts:refreshOutputInventory` reads one flat response from
`GET /build/sessions/{id}/outputs`. Each file has a path, size, and opaque revision.
Artifacts derives its folder tree from this same inventory without directory requests.
It shows loading, failed, and incomplete reads separately from complete empty results.
Partial first reads can display known files but cannot establish a discovery baseline.
Activating Artifacts reconciles the inventory; only idle sessions use a silent refresh.
The browser does not walk output directories.
Session loading and pre-provisioning fetch the inventory in the background.
Messages send immediately, using the last successful inventory for discovery.
Neither message submission nor turn completion waits for inventory reads.
The first complete response establishes a silent baseline, even if a task has already created files.
Those files appear in Artifacts but do not automatically open. Later discoveries can open normally.
Partial initial reads cannot establish the baseline.
Idle cached sessions reconcile revisions on entry and focus without adding tabs or changing selection.
Reloading the page discards the inventory; nothing is written to the database or local storage.
Reads allow 35 seconds per attempt, covering the backend's 30-second RPC deadline and HTTP overhead.
Failed reads retry twice, after one and two seconds. Retries retain their original turn and selection rules.
An incomplete scan preserves known entries and waits for a later refresh to establish a complete baseline.
This can occur when a tree exceeds scan limits or contains an unreadable directory.

`useBuildSessionStore.ts:compareOutputInventory` compares paths and metadata
revisions. Completed shell and edit tools, including child-agent tools,
schedule a refresh. The private queue in `useBuildStreaming.ts` combines rapid
completions and reconciles when the stream settles, even if it missed every tool packet.
Tool completions during a read coalesce into one pending refresh.
Settlement replaces that pending work with one final read, queued immediately.
The store serializes all inventory reads per session, including focus and panel reads.
A silent read cannot consume new files before pending turn discovery selects them.
An already-settled turn also triggers reconciliation when the attach returns no stream.
Partial responses retain unseen entries. Failed responses preserve the last
inventory. Queued reads and responses from older turns are ignored.
Aborted queued reads do not issue a request. Completed queues are released.

New previewable files add tabs. One shared transition selects the first eligible output,
opens the panel, and locks automatic selection for the task. Files and ready webapps
use the same interruption, dismissal, and manual-navigation checks.
Within that batch, PowerPoint and PDF take priority over Markdown and images.
Later files add tabs without changing the selection. This also works when the
panel is already open. Opening, selecting, and locking the selection happen in
one store update. Other formats update the inventory without opening a generic tab;
helper scripts must not reveal an empty Artifacts view before the deliverable exists. Changed files
refresh their previews without selecting a tab. Deleted files invalidate their
previews. Each mounted viewer caches one payload for its file path, inventory
revision, and explicit reload counter. Reload counters are per file and change only
when the user requests a reload. The panel retains up to five recently visited tab
bodies, preserving scroll, slide selection, and unchanged preview bytes across
switches. Retained iframes stay in stable DOM order. Closed tabs, evicted tabs, and
prior sessions release their viewer caches. Closing the panel releases its bodies
after the animation. Hidden file viewers retain their displayed revision and load
the latest revision on activation. Files without inventory revisions revalidate
when their preview mounts or becomes active. Each successful PowerPoint conversion response gives
slide images a fresh browser cache token; unchanged retained viewers reuse it.
PDF activation reads without revisions reuse the displayed Blob when bytes match.
Changed bytes replace the PDF; previews release their object URL on replacement or unmount. Presentation
keyboard navigation stays inside the active viewer.

The first automatic output selection, manual tab selection, closing a tab or the panel, and
history navigation suppress further automatic selection for the current turn.
A single `outputSelectionLocked` flag controls this behavior independently of panel visibility.
A new interactive turn clears the lock. Reopening the panel does not clear it.
Scheduled runs use fresh sessions; reattaching preserves their selection lock.
Explicit file clicks still open their preview. The inventory keeps updating while navigation
is suppressed, so old changes do not appear as new files later.
Selecting the current history entry preserves Back and Forward history instead of adding a duplicate entry.

CSV files display a sticky-header table limited to 1,000 rows, 100 columns, and 5,000 cells.
CSV viewers report malformed quoted fields and offer a raw download through the preview toolbar.
The CSV preview uses the shared parser directly. Parser tests live with the shared utility.
Image previews offer a contrast background toggle.
Presentation thumbnails support pointer and keyboard resizing.

## 5. Contracts and invariants

1. **Craft does not reuse chat's `Packet`/`Placement`.** It has its own two
   families (§4.4), no `placement` field, and no `turn_index`/`tab_index`
   coordinate system. A reader who assumes chat's contract will look for
   fields that do not exist here.
2. **`event_schema.py` is the sole import point for `acp.schema`.** Nothing
   else in the tree should `from acp.schema import ...` directly (verified:
   `grep -ri acp backend/onyx/server/features/build/` turns up only this
   wrapper, `serve_client.py`'s docstring, and `session/{streaming,manager}.py`
   /`session/api.py` importing the wrapper's names). Swapping or inlining the
   upstream types is a one-file change as long as this holds.
3. **An unknown packet must not crash the frontend.** `parsePacket`
   (`web/src/app/craft/utils/parsePacket.ts:parsePacket`) returns
   `{ type: "unknown" }` for anything it does not recognize, mirroring
   `findRenderer`'s `null` in [[streaming-protocol]]. Adding a packet type here
   needs a `parsePacket.ts` case or it renders as nothing.
4. **A successful turn ends on `session.idle` / `session.status:{type:idle}`. An error
   can end it earlier.** `message.updated` with `info.error` and `session.error` both
   emit an `Error` terminator. `message.updated` fires once per inner opencode step, not once per
   turn; treating it as a terminator drops every step after the first (see
   `docs/craft/issues/opencode-serve-event-stream-pitfalls.md` §1). This is
   fixed in `translate_opencode_event`, not a live risk, but any new
   consumer of the opencode event stream must respect it.
5. **Tagged-union payloads (`session.status`) are inspected by `.type`, not by
   string equality on the outer field**, per the same pitfalls doc §2.
6. **Content deltas can arrive before their message's role is known.**
   `_is_assistant_message` (`serve_client.py`) hydrates unknown message ids via
   a synchronous `GET /session/{id}/message/{id}` rather than buffering and
   hoping metadata arrives later (pitfalls doc §3). A new content-classifying
   code path must go through this cache-or-hydrate chokepoint, not invent its
   own buffering.
7. **The runner is the only writer of persisted turn state; the browser
   attach never drives the turn.** `get_interactive_turn_events` only
   restarts a stalled runner (`maybe_start_runner`); it does not itself call
   `send_message`. Do not add a code path where an attach can duplicate a
   prompt POST.
8. **At most one runner drives a turn.** `claim_turn_for_runner`
   (`interactive_turns/state.py`) is a runner-id compare-and-set; a second
   runner only takes over once the first is stale
   (`RUNNER_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS`, six keepalive intervals). Do not add a second
   path that starts a runner without going through this claim.
9. **There is no packet-level reconnect buffer.** Unlike
   [[streaming-protocol]]'s `stream_buffer.py`, nothing compresses and stores
   every SSE line Craft emits. A client that attaches after missing events
   gets an empty per-subscriber queue (bounded, `maxsize=500`, per
   `_Subscription`). It receives only events the turn emits after the attach. What it lost is recoverable only
   through the **persisted** `BuildMessage` rows via
   `GET /sessions/{id}/messages`, which is a different, coarser shape (no
   `ToolCallStart`, no `CurrentModeUpdate`, no live deltas), not a replay of
   the wire format. See §9.
10. **There is no terminal channel.** There is no `/build/sessions/{id}/terminal` websocket, no PTY
    bridge, and no `xterm.js` integration anywhere under `web/src/app/craft/`
    (verified by grep; the only websocket route in `webapp_proxy.py` is the
    Next.js dev-server HMR proxy, `websocket_webapp_hmr`, which is unrelated
    and belongs to [[craft-webapp-proxy]]).

---

## 6. Relationships

**Depends on**
- [[craft-sandboxes]]: `PodEventBus` and `OpencodeServeClient` talk to the
  `opencode serve` process the sandbox pod runs; session-preservation across
  sandbox sleep/restore is a sandbox-layer concern this component only
  consumes (opencode session id resolution in `_ensure_opencode_session_id`,
  `session/streaming.py`).
- [[craft-sessions]]: owns `BuildSession`/`BuildMessage`; this component is
  the writer of the streaming-derived rows on them.
- [[craft-external-apps]]: `ConnectAppRequestPacket` and
  `ApprovalRequestedPacket` originate from tool-permission handling this
  component's client surfaces but does not own.

**Depended on by**
- [[chat-frontend]] has no relationship to this component; Craft's frontend
  is entirely separate (`web/src/app/craft/`), which is itself the main
  consumer.
- [[craft-admin]]: no direct dependency, but disabling Craft for a user/org
  removes access to every endpoint in §2.
- [[craft-webapp-proxy]]: shares the session's live preview surface but not
  the event stream; cross-linked because both are per-session live channels
  reached through the same `/build` router.

**Contrast with [[streaming-protocol]]**
Chat's stream is one HTTP request that both drives and delivers the turn, with
a durable compressed buffer enabling a real resume. Craft's stream is a
detached background runner plus an attach-only SSE endpoint with no packet
buffer; reconnection means "see what's still live," not "replay everything I
missed."

| If your change... | Also check |
|---|---|

## 8. How to verify a change

### Tests

```bash
# Unit tests for the opencode-event translator (the highest-value tests here)
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/onyx/server/features/craft/sandbox/test_translate_opencode_event.py

# Craft integration tests exercising a live turn end to end
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/integration -k craft
```

Frontend regression tests for output discovery and panel selection:

```bash
cd web && bun run test --runInBand useBuildStreaming.test.tsx useBuildSessionStore.outputs.test.ts
```

`backend/tests/external_dependency_unit/craft/test_streaming_persistence.py`
exercises `persist_sandbox_event` against real sandbox-event payloads.

### Manual reproduction

`docs/craft/dev/local-compose-craft.md` is the setup guide for the Docker
sandbox backend specifically (proxy iteration); for general Craft streaming
work against the default Kubernetes backend, follow
`docs/craft/dev/local-kubernetes.md` instead (referenced by the compose doc).

1. Confirm services are up: `tail -f backend/log/api_server_debug.log`.
2. Open the browser devtools Network tab, send a Craft message, and inspect
   the `GET /sessions/{id}/turns/{turn_id}/events` response: newline-delimited
   `event: message\ndata: {...}` blocks, each with a recognizable `type`.
3. Reload the tab mid-turn. Confirm the client calls
   `GET /sessions/{id}/turns/active` then re-attaches to `.../events`, and the
   transcript keeps growing rather than restarting.
4. Trigger a `task` (sub-agent) tool call. Confirm only its prompt and final
   text appear in the parent transcript. Open the sub-agent view and confirm
   it shows the sub-agent's thinking and tool calls (see §9).

---

## 9. Footguns

- **`docs/craft/features/streaming/` is mostly history, not a design to
  verify against.** `drop-acp-layer.md` states the ACP transport (`opencode
  acp`, `ACPExecClient`/`DockerACPExecClient`, `AGENT_TRANSPORT` env var) is
  fully deleted, and this is confirmed in code: only `event_schema.py`'s
  wrapper, `serve_client.py`'s docstring, and a few docstrings/imports in
  `session/{streaming,manager,api}.py` still say "acp" (as the name of the
  PyPI wrapper module, `sandbox.event_schema`, or historical comments); there
  is no live ACP exec-client code path left. `shared-acp-exec-client.md` and
  `docker-opencode-serve.md` describe now-deleted machinery entirely.
  `opencode-serve-client.md` and `preserve-opencode-sessions.md` are closer to
  current (the latter is actively cited by `session/streaming.py`'s own
  `_ensure_opencode_session_id`), but treat every doc under this directory as
  something to verify against `serve_client.py`/`serve_transport.py` before
  trusting, not as ground truth.
- **The event stream is a hint, not the source of truth.** All three bugs in
  `docs/craft/issues/opencode-serve-event-stream-pitfalls.md` (premature
  per-step termination, string-vs-tagged-union comparison, racing content
  deltas) share one lesson: when the stream is ambiguous, fall back to a REST
  call against opencode's persisted state (`get_message`), don't invent
  compensating stream-side logic.
- **Deploy-time gotchas are RBAC and env-refresh, not streaming logic**
  (`docs/craft/issues/opencode-serve-deploy-gotchas.md`): a missing `secrets`
  RBAC verb on the sandbox namespace, Kubernetes not refreshing
  `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` on a live pod after a Secret update (needs a pod
  delete), and mutable image tags serving stale content under
  `IfNotPresent`. None of these are bugs in the translator; they surface as
  streaming symptoms (`ProviderModelNotFoundError`, connection refused on
  `/session`) that look like transport bugs but aren't.
- **No terminal/PTY channel exists.** An old design note that mentions one
  describes an unbuilt branch; see §5.10.
- **The sub-agent view follows the main turn stream, with no stream of its own.**
  `web/src/app/craft/components/SubagentView.tsx` renders from `ChatPanel.tsx`
  when `viewedSubagentSessionId` is set. `AgentSwitcher.tsx` sets it through
  `useBuildSessionStore.ts:viewSubagent`. There is no dedicated sub-agent
  event-stream endpoint. Child events arrive on the main turn stream.
  `utils/subagentRouting.ts:classifySubagentEvent` splits them from the main
  transcript. `useBuildStreaming.ts` (live path) and `useBuildSessionStore.ts`
  (history reload) both use it, so the two paths agree. The view reuses
  `BuildMessageList` and follows the run while the sub-agent status is `running`.
  The main transcript still gets a synthetic final-answer message for a
  completed `task` tool call (`persist_sandbox_event`'s `is_task_tool` branch).
- **A stuck runner is only reclaimed after `RUNNER_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` (six
  keepalive intervals, ~90s).** A rapid page reload during that window can
  make the attach endpoint wait rather than force a restart; this is
  deliberate (avoids double-driving a healthy turn) but reads as latency if
  you don't know the constant.
