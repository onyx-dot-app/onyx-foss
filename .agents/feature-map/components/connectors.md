# Connectors

> The boundary between Onyx and the outside world. A connector pulls documents
> from one source type, in one of a small set of standard shapes, and hands
> plain `Document` objects to indexing. It never chunks, embeds, or writes to
> the index, and it never touches credential encryption directly.

**Verified against:** `268e4d5a3d` (2026-10-05)
**Domain:** ingestion
**Edition:** CE for the connector interfaces, the registry, and indexing
(`CredentialCapability.INDEXING`). EE adds the two permission-sync capabilities
(`DOC_PERMISSION_SYNC`, `EXTERNAL_GROUP_SYNC`); `capability_checks/applicability.py`
gates them behind `fetch_ee_implementation_or_noop`.
**Owns:**
`backend/onyx/connectors/interfaces.py`, `models.py`, `registry.py`, `factory.py`,
`capabilities.py`, `connector_runner.py`, `credentials_provider.py`, `exceptions.py`,
`source_operations.py`, `capability_checks/`, `cross_connector_utils/`, and the
individual `backend/onyx/connectors/<source>/` implementation packages (not owned
individually; see §2 for the canonical list).

**Does not own:** turning a `Document` into chunks, embeddings, and index writes
([[indexing-pipeline]] owns that, starting from the batches `ConnectorRunner`
yields); the `Connector`/`Credential`/`ConnectorCredentialPair` tables, credential
encryption, and the cc-pair admin lifecycle ([[cc-pairs-and-credentials]] owns
those; this document only describes the shape of the config and credential a
connector receives); compiling `external_access` into search-time ACL filters
([[access-control]] and [[permission-sync]] own that; a connector only emits the
field).

**Read first:** `backend/onyx/connectors/README.md`. It is the contributor guide
for adding a new source. This document maps it to code, corrects two places
where the code has grown past it, and adds verification guidance.

## 1. What the user experiences

An admin opens **Add Connector**, picks a source (for example Confluence), and
authenticates: an API token, an OAuth flow, or a service-account key, depending
on the source. They then scope what to pull, for example a space key or a CQL
query for Confluence, a set of channels for Slack, a shared drive for Google
Drive. Saving creates the connector and kicks off an initial index run. The
admin watches the connector's status move from indexing to a document count and
a "last successful index" timestamp on the connector status page. From then on,
a background job polls for new and changed documents on a schedule the admin
sets, and a separate job prunes documents that were deleted at the source.

For connectors that implement `validate_connector_settings` or named capability
checks (§4), the admin sees a validation error at connector-creation time if
credentials are wrong or a permission is missing. The base
`validate_connector_settings` is a no-op. A connector that does not override
it, for example Asana, can pass creation with bad credentials. The problem then
shows only when an index run fails or returns nothing.

## 2. Surfaces

### Admin routes (frontend)

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `web/src/app/admin/connectors/page.tsx` | The source picker (re-exports `web/src/views/admin/connectors/CatalogPage.tsx`): cards for every entry in `SOURCE_METADATA_MAP`. `/admin/add-connector` redirects here (`web/next.config.js`). |
| `web/src/app/admin/connectors/[connector]/` | The dynamic per-source config route: renders the form described by `connectorConfigs[source]`. |

### Frontend config surfaces

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `web/src/lib/connectors/connectors.tsx` | `connectorConfigs`, keyed by source: the form schema (fields, types, defaults) the add-connector page renders and posts as `connector_specific_config`. |
| `web/src/lib/sources.ts` | `SOURCE_METADATA_MAP`: icon, display name, and docs link per source, read by `getSourceMetadata`/`isValidSource`-style helpers. |

`backend/onyx/connectors/README.md:96,113` names exactly these two files as the
frontend changes a new connector requires.

### Backend HTTP endpoints (`backend/onyx/server/documents/connector.py`, prefix `/manage`)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/admin/connector` | Create a `Connector` row (`create_connector_from_model`). |
| PATCH | `/admin/connector/{connector_id}` | Update config, schedule, etc. |
| DELETE | `/admin/connector/{connector_id}` | |
| POST | `/admin/connector/run-once` | On-demand index trigger. |
| GET | `/admin/connector/status`, `/admin/connector/indexing-status` (POST) | Status and index-attempt history for the admin UI. |
| GET | `/admin/connector/failed-indexing-status` | |
| POST | `/admin/connector/file/upload`, GET/POST `/admin/connector/{id}/files*` | File-connector-specific upload and file-list management. |
| GET | `/connector/{google-drive,gmail}/authorize/{credential_id}`, `/callback` | Google-specific OAuth flows in `connector.py`. |
| GET | `/connector/oauth/authorize/{source}`, `/callback/{source}`, `/details/{source}` | Generic OAuth flow for every `OAuthConnector` implementation (`server/documents/standard_oauth.py`). |
| POST/GET | `/admin/credential/{credential_id}/capability-check`, `/capability-report`, `/admin/credential/capability-reports`, `/admin/credential/{credential_id}/binding-check` | Run and read capability checks, and check credential-bound config fields (`server/documents/credential_capabilities.py`). |
| POST/GET | `/admin/connector-checks/runs`, `/admin/connector-checks/runs/{run_id}` | Draft capability-check runs on an unsaved connector form (`server/documents/capability_check_runs.py`). |
| POST | `/admin/connector-checks/plan` | The checks a draft run would hold for an unsaved form, each in its state before anything runs (pending, waiting, not applicable). Needs no credential and starts no run. |
| GET | `/connector`, `/connector/{connector_id}`, `/indexed-sources` | Read paths, including the anonymous-ish `/connector-status` used by chat surfaces. |

Every connector run on a cc-pair (index, prune, hierarchy fetch, targeted reindex,
capability check) goes through
`backend/onyx/connectors/factory.py:instantiate_connector` before it touches the
source. User-file ingestion is the exception: it builds `LocalFileConnector`
directly in `user_file_processing/tasks.py:_load_user_file_documents`. See §4.

### The `DocumentSource` enum: the canonical list

`backend/onyx/configs/constants.py:DocumentSource` has 62 members and is the
single source of truth for "what is a valid source in Onyx". It is **not** 1:1
with `backend/onyx/connectors/registry.py:CONNECTOR_CLASS_MAP`. Four members
have no connector class and are handled by other components instead:

| `DocumentSource` value | Why it has no connector |
|---|---|
| `INGESTION_API` | Documents pushed directly via the ingestion API, no fetch step. |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | Used for federated-search-only pseudo-sources. |
| `USER_FILE` | User-uploaded files; owned by [[file-store-and-user-files]]. |
| `CRAFT_FILE` | Raw binary files for the Craft sandbox; no text extraction. |

`DocumentSource.MOCK_CONNECTOR` does have a registry entry
(`onyx.connectors.mock_connector.connector.MockConnector`) for integration
tests. A separate `FederatedConnectorSource` enum
(`backend/onyx/configs/constants.py:FederatedConnectorSource`) maps a
federated-only source like `FEDERATED_SLACK` back to the `DocumentSource` it
shadows; see [[federated-search]].

Do not enumerate all 58 registered connectors here. `DocumentSource` plus
`registry.py:CONNECTOR_CLASS_MAP` is the authoritative list. The handful of
architecturally distinct *shapes* those connectors take are in §4 and §6.

---

## 3. Data model

### The `Connector` table

`backend/onyx/db/models.py:Connector` (`connector` table): `id`, `name`,
`source` (`DocumentSource`), `input_type` (`InputType`),
`connector_specific_config` (JSONB, the kwargs passed to the connector's
`__init__`), `indexing_start`, `refresh_freq`, `prune_freq`,
`kg_processing_enabled`, `kg_coverage_days`. A `Connector` row is not runnable
by itself; it is paired with a `Credential` through `ConnectorCredentialPair`.
[[cc-pairs-and-credentials]] owns that table, the `Credential` table, and
encryption. This component only consumes the pairing at run time (§4).

### The document model a connector emits (`backend/onyx/connectors/models.py`)

- **`Section` / `TextSection` / `ImageSection` / `TabularSection`**: a
  `SectionType`-discriminated union. `TextSection.text` is inline text.
  `ImageSection.image_file_id` points at a file-store blob. `TabularSection`
  stages a CSV in the file store (`csv_file_id`) and is streamed row-by-row at
  chunk time so a large sheet never sits on the worker heap
  (`TabularSection.materialize_text`).
- **`DocumentBase`** / **`Document`** (`Document` requires `id`, `source`,
  `sections`, `semantic_identifier`, and `metadata`. On `DocumentBase`, `id` and
  `source` are optional, and the other three are still required. The remaining
  fields are optional): `id` (the stable
  dedup key, see §5), `sections`, `semantic_identifier` (the UI display
  identifier), `title` (falls back to `semantic_identifier` via
  `get_title_for_document_index`), `metadata` (dict of string/string-list,
  turned into filterable key-value pairs by
  `convert_metadata_dict_to_list_of_strings`), `doc_updated_at`/`doc_created_at`,
  `primary_owners`/`secondary_owners` (`BasicExpertInfo`), `external_access`
  (`ExternalAccess | None`, optional connector-provided metadata. Many
  connectors fill it only during permission-sync runs. Some, such as
  `GmailConnector`, fill it on every indexing run. Flows to [[access-control]]), `parent_hierarchy_raw_node_id` (links
  a document to a `HierarchyNode`), `file_id`, `additional_info` (opaque,
  connector-specific).
- **`Document.content_hash`**: an MD5 fingerprint over title, text, image ids, sorted
  `doc_metadata` (not the filter `metadata` field), and sorted owners, computed before image summarization runs. It is
  the fallback dedup gate for connectors that don't supply `doc_updated_at`
  (the web connector is the example in the docstring).
- **`SlimDocument`**: `id`, `external_access`, `parent_hierarchy_raw_node_id`,
  `doc_created_at`. What a slim connector yields instead of a full `Document`.
- **`HierarchyNode`**: a folder/space/page structural node (`raw_node_id`,
  `raw_parent_id`, `display_name`, `node_type`, `external_access`), distinct
  from the SQLAlchemy `HierarchyNode` row it becomes during docprocessing.
- **`ConnectorCheckpoint`**: base class is just `{has_more: bool}`. Real
  connectors subclass it with whatever cursor state they need; see the case
  studies in §4. Checkpoints must round-trip through
  `CheckpointedConnector.validate_checkpoint_json`.
- **`ConnectorFailure`** (`DocumentFailure` or `EntityFailure`, exactly one):
  yielded alongside documents so one bad item doesn't fail an entire batch.
- `credential_capability_report` (`backend/onyx/db/models.py:CredentialCapabilityReportRow`):
  the persisted outcome of a capability check run (§4, §5).

---

## 4. How it works

### 4.1 The connector flows that actually exist

The README describes four flows (Load, Poll, Slim, Event). The real interface
set in `backend/onyx/connectors/interfaces.py` is larger:

| Base class | Method | Driven by a background job today? |
|---|---|---|
| `LoadConnector` | `load_from_state` | Rarely for the generic index path; the direct call site is `backend/onyx/background/celery/tasks/user_file_processing/tasks.py:_load_user_file_documents`, used for user-uploaded files via `LocalFileConnector`, not the connector index loop. |
| `PollConnector` | `poll_source` | Only as a fallback inside `backend/onyx/background/celery/celery_utils.py:extract_ids_from_runnable_connector` when pruning a non-slim, non-checkpointed connector. `ConnectorRunner` also supports it directly, but no shipped connector both lacks `CheckpointedConnector` and is exercised through the primary indexing path today. |
| `CheckpointedConnector` | `load_from_checkpoint` | **Yes, this is the primary indexing path.** Driven by `backend/onyx/connectors/connector_runner.py:ConnectorRunner.run`, called from `backend/onyx/background/indexing/run_docfetching.py`, which `backend/onyx/background/celery/tasks/docfetching/tasks.py:_docfetching_task` invokes. |
| `CheckpointedConnectorWithPermSync` | `load_from_checkpoint_with_perm_sync` | Same call chain as above, selected by `ConnectorRunner` when `include_permissions=True`. |
| `SlimConnector` | `retrieve_all_slim_docs` | Yes: `celery_utils.py:extract_ids_from_runnable_connector`, called from `backend/onyx/background/celery/tasks/pruning/tasks.py:connector_pruning_generator_task`, beat-scheduled via `check_for_pruning`. |
| `SlimConnectorWithPermSync` | `retrieve_all_slim_docs_perm_sync` | Same pruning call chain, and consumed by EE permission-sync jobs. |
| `Resolver` | `reindex` | Yes, but on demand, not beat-scheduled: `backend/onyx/background/indexing/run_targeted_reindex.py:process_targets_for_cc_pair`, reached from the admin-triggered `backend/onyx/background/celery/tasks/docprocessing/targeted_reindex_task.py`. Re-fetches specific documents named by stored `ConnectorFailure` rows. |
| `HierarchyConnector` | `load_hierarchy` | Yes, beat-scheduled: `backend/onyx/background/celery/tasks/hierarchyfetching/tasks.py:_run_hierarchy_extraction`, gated by `_is_hierarchy_fetching_due`. |
| `CredentialsConnector` | `set_credentials_provider` | Not a fetch flow; a marker interface `factory.py:instantiate_connector` checks to decide whether to call `load_credentials` or hand over a `CredentialsProviderInterface` (§4.3). |
| `OAuthConnector` | `oauth_*` classmethods | Backs the generic `/connector/oauth/*` endpoints in §2. Egnyte, Linear, and Salesforce implement it. Google Drive and Gmail use their own endpoints. |

**`CheckpointedConnector` is the modern path.** `PollConnector`/`LoadConnector`
are legacy for the main index loop; new connectors should implement
checkpointing (`backend/onyx/connectors/README.md` predates this shift and
still frames Load/Poll as the two primary flows, but `factory.py`'s own
`_validate_connector_supports_input_type` already treats `CheckpointedConnector`
as satisfying an `InputType.POLL` request).

**Slim connectors exist so pruning can list document IDs cheaply.** Confirmed:
`retrieve_all_slim_docs`/`_perm_sync` return `SlimDocument` (just `id`,
`external_access`, `parent_hierarchy_raw_node_id`, `doc_created_at`), never full
content. `retrieve_all_slim_docs` is consumed only by the pruning diff in §4.4.
`retrieve_all_slim_docs_perm_sync` is also consumed by EE permission-sync jobs
(`ee/onyx/external_permissions/utils.py`). A slim connector
does the same enumeration as the full connector without downloading bodies.

### 4.2 Registry and factory: source to running instance

1. `backend/onyx/connectors/registry.py:CONNECTOR_CLASS_MAP` maps each
   `DocumentSource` to a `ConnectorMapping(module_path, class_name)`, never the
   class object itself, so importing the registry never imports every SDK.
`ConnectorMapping` also carries a `config_class`, a `ConnectorConfig` subclass from
   `<source>/config.py` (`connector_config.py`). It types `connector_specific_config` and
   forbids unknown keys.
2. `factory.py:_load_connector_class` imports the module lazily on first use
   and caches the class in `_connector_cache`. A missing map entry raises
   `ConnectorMissingException` (only at first instantiation, not at import
   time; see §9).
3. `factory.py:identify_connector_class` additionally validates the class
   against a requested `InputType` via `_validate_connector_supports_input_type`.
4. `factory.py:instantiate_connector` builds the instance:
   `connector_class(**build_connector_kwargs(source, config))`, then branches on
   `isinstance(connector, CredentialsConnector)`:
   - **True**: builds an `OnyxDBCredentialsProvider` via
     `credentials_provider.py:build_db_credentials_provider` and calls
     `connector.set_credentials_provider(provider)`. The connector never sees
     the raw credential dict; it pulls through the provider. `get_credentials()` does
     not take a lock. The connector must enter the provider as a context manager
     (`__enter__`) around a renewal to take the Redis lock
     (`OnyxDBCredentialsProvider.LOCK_TTL = 900`), which matters for
     credentials that rotate mid-run.
   - **False**: decrypts `credential.credential_json` once, converts it with
     `credential_families.py:to_source_credential_json`, calls
     `connector.load_credentials(credential_json)`, and if the connector
     returns a refreshed dict, writes it back via
     `backend_update_credential_json`.
   `build_connector_kwargs` validates the stored config against `config_class`. If
   validation fails, it logs a warning and passes the stored config through as is, because
   old rows may not conform.
   Either way, `connector.set_allow_images(...)` and, if a raw-file callback
   was supplied, `connector.set_raw_file_callback(...)` run afterward.

### 4.3 Credentials without the connector knowing about encryption

`credentials_provider.py` gives a connector two implementations of
`CredentialsProviderInterface`, both handing back a plain dict:
`OnyxDBCredentialsProvider` (dynamic, DB-backed, lock taken on `__enter__`, used for real
cc-pairs) and `OnyxStaticCredentialsProvider` (in-memory, used by tests and the
`if __name__ == "__main__"` manual-test pattern the README recommends).
`is_dynamic()` tells a connector whether it must re-acquire the lock around
renewal. Neither implementation is visible to the connector as anything but
`get_credentials()`/`set_credentials()`; decryption happens inside
`OnyxDBCredentialsProvider.get_credentials`, not in connector code.

### 4.4 A fetch run through `connector_runner.py`

`ConnectorRunner.__init__` rejects `include_permissions=True` for anything that
isn't a `CheckpointedConnector`. `ConnectorRunner.run(checkpoint)`:

- For a `CheckpointedConnector`: calls `load_from_checkpoint` (or
  `_with_perm_sync`), wraps the raw generator in
  `CheckpointOutputWrapper`, which separates `Document | HierarchyNode |
  ConnectorFailure` items and captures the generator's `StopIteration` return
  value as the next checkpoint. Hierarchy nodes are flushed to the caller
  **before** documents in every batch boundary, to keep the parent-before-child
  invariant intact for [[indexing-pipeline]].
- For a legacy `PollConnector`/`LoadConnector`: builds a dummy finished
  checkpoint (`has_more=False`) after draining `poll_source`/`load_from_state`.

The docfetching entrypoint (`backend/onyx/background/indexing/run_docfetching.py`)
drives this generator, batches the yielded documents onward, and persists the
returned checkpoint. An interrupted attempt resumes from that checkpoint on the
next scheduled run. After a successful attempt, the next run starts with a fresh
dummy checkpoint (`run_docfetching.py`).
[[indexing-pipeline]] owns everything from "batch of `Document` objects
received" onward: chunking, embedding, and the index write.

### 4.5 Pruning: the slim diff

`backend/onyx/background/celery/tasks/pruning/tasks.py:connector_pruning_generator_task`
loads `all_indexed_document_ids` for the cc-pair from Postgres, calls
`celery_utils.py:extract_ids_from_runnable_connector` to get
`all_connector_doc_ids` from the slim connector, and computes
`doc_ids_to_remove = all_indexed_document_ids - all_connector_doc_ids.keys()`.
See §5 for the invariant this depends on.

### 4.6 Three representative shapes

Do not read all 58 connectors. These three (chosen for the README) span the
range:

| Connector | Base classes | Checkpoint | Notable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Confluence (`confluence/connector.py:ConfluenceConnector`) | `CheckpointedConnector`, `SlimConnector`, `SlimConnectorWithPermSync`, `CredentialsConnector`, `Resolver` | `ConfluenceCheckpoint` (`next_page_url`) | No `LoadConnector`/`PollConnector`; checkpointing is mandatory, not optional. `load_credentials` deliberately raises `NotImplementedError("Use set_credentials_provider with this connector.")`. Has a `source_operations.py` gateway (`ConfluenceSourceOperations`) and registers named capability checks. |
| Google Drive (`google_drive/connector.py:GoogleDriveConnector`) | `SlimConnector`, `SlimConnectorWithPermSync`, `CheckpointedConnectorWithPermSync`, `Resolver` | `GoogleDriveCheckpoint` (`google_drive/models.py`): a multi-stage state machine (`DriveRetrievalStage`: `START → OAUTH_FILES → USER_EMAILS → MY_DRIVE_FILES → DRIVE_IDS → SHARED_DRIVE_FILES → DONE`) plus a per-impersonated-user completion map. Not a simple cursor. | Splits source-API logic across `file_retrieval.py`, `doc_conversion.py`, `section_extraction.py` rather than a single `source_operations.py`. |
| Slack (`slack/connector.py:SlackConnector`) | `SlimConnectorWithPermSync`, `CredentialsConnector`, `CheckpointedConnectorWithPermSync` | `SlackCheckpoint`: `channel_ids`, per-channel completion map, `current_channel_access` (carries an in-flight channel's `ExternalAccess` across a checkpoint boundary) | Has a real `source_operations.py` (`SlackSourceOperations`), the enforced single import site for `slack_sdk`. `external_access` is assigned inline on yielded documents, not in a separate pass. |

### 4.6.1 Outlook: one document per mail thread

`outlook/connector.py:OutlookConnector` is the one connector whose document is
not a source object but a thread shared across mailboxes, so its run has a
shape the table above does not cover:

- **Thread key.** Every message copy carries a `conversationIndex`; its 22-byte
  root is the same in every mailbox that holds the thread (`threads.py:thread_key`),
  and the first message's index is the root alone (`is_thread_root`). Copies
  are matched message by message on the Internet Message-ID
  (`OutlookMessageIdentity.match_id`).
- **Decided per mailbox, from headers.** Each mailbox is walked on its own,
  eight side by side. Its folders are read through delta pages of metadata
  with the sender and recipients (`CHANGE_SELECT`), one page per checkpoint
  step, and the rows are held in the connector process (`_MailboxListing`)
  until the last folder is done. The checkpoint (`OutlookCheckpoint`) holds
  cursors only; a process that resumes an attempt has no listing for the
  mailboxes in flight and walks them again from the start (`_resumable`).
  Nothing is written outside the process: no file store, no database.
- **Builder, readers, copies.** `threads.py:plan_documents` turns one
  mailbox's copy of a thread into documents. The first message names the
  builder (`designated_builder`: its sender when the run walks that mailbox,
  else the lowest named mailbox id, passing over any mailbox the run cannot
  open, probed once per process by `_mailbox_available`). The builder's
  newest 100 indexable messages make `outlook-thread:<key>`, readable by the
  mailboxes named on every one of them: named, not holding, so a recipient
  who deleted a message or never received it still reads the thread. A mailbox the first message names but a later message
  left out gets `outlook-thread:<key>:<mailbox id>` from the builder, holding
  the messages that name it. Whatever the builder cannot see, a copy without
  the first message, a thread whose first message names no walked mailbox, a
  holder it does not name, or a reply that left the builder out, is written
  by its own mailbox as `outlook-thread:<key>:<mailbox id>:own`.
- **Known limits.** The builder's copy is the thread. A reply the builder
  deleted or filed in an excluded folder is indexed nowhere, since the other
  holders assume a message naming the builder is the builder's to write. A
  thread whose builder mailbox no longer holds its first message is not
  built at all; the other holders keep only their own documents of the
  replies that left the builder out. The
  builder's first message sits in its Sent Items, so excluding that folder
  has the same effect on every thread the mailbox started. The listing in
  memory is bounded by one mailbox per worker, eight at once, and by
  `MAX_LISTING_ROWS_PER_MAILBOX` (250k): a larger mailbox is a recorded
  failure for indexing and aborts a slim walk. A checkpoint from the earlier
  table-based walk starts the attempt over.
- **Polls.** Only messages in the window are listed, so each conversation
  with new mail is read whole through its outline (`_conversation_outline`),
  the oldest message fetched separately when the outline stops short of it,
  and decided by the same function. Readers come from the newest 100
  messages, so the daily permission sync can widen a document's readers
  before the next poll rebuilds its text.
- **Prune and permission sync.** `_slim_docs` lists each mailbox the same way,
  in memory one mailbox per worker, and yields the ids and readers
  `plan_documents` gives, so the slim diff (§4.5) and the doc sync see the
  documents indexing built.

### 4.7 The `SourceOperations` gateway pattern

`source_operations.py` defines an ABC, `SourceOperations`, that a connector's
own `<source>/source_operations.py` subclasses to become the single place that
source-API calls happen. `@source_operation` stamps a `SourceOperationSpec`
(capabilities served, `OperationConsumes`, optional named `variants` for calls
whose required permission depends on an argument) onto each public method;
`SourceOperations.__init_subclass__` raises at import time if any public
method on the subclass lacks the stamp, or if the subclass overrides
`__init__`. Operations must return plain data, never live SDK objects, because
lazily-evaluated SDK attribute access (PyGithub, office365) can fire network
calls outside any wrapper. Only Slack, Confluence, OneDrive, and Outlook have a gateway today
(`<source>/source_operations.py`); most connectors still call their SDK directly.

### 4.8 Capabilities and capability checks

`capabilities.py:CredentialCapability` (`INDEXING`, `DOC_PERMISSION_SYNC`,
`EXTERNAL_GROUP_SYNC`) is the vocabulary. `capability_checks/applicability.py`
decides which capabilities apply to a source on this build (CE: `INDEXING`
only; EE adds the perm-sync ones). `capability_checks/registry.py` maps a
source to named `CapabilityCheck`s (only Slack, Confluence, OneDrive, and Outlook register real ones
today; every other source gets a synthesized fallback wrapping
`validate_connector_settings`). A source with named checks must have a
`SourceOperations` gateway; `get_capability_checks` asserts this. `capability_checks/runner.py:generate_capability_report`
instantiates the connector in isolation with a timeout guard, builds the
source's `SourceOperations` gateway if one is registered, and runs checks
sequentially (source APIs rate-limit) via `run_capability_checks`, mapping
`ConnectorValidationError` to `FAILED` and anything else ambiguous to
`INDETERMINATE`, never to `FAILED`. `CapabilityCheckTrigger`
(`backend/onyx/db/enums.py`): `MANUAL`, `CREDENTIAL_CREATED`,
`CC_PAIR_VALIDATION`, `INDEXING_ATTEMPT`, `PERM_SYNC_ATTEMPT`. The simpler,
existing blocking-validation path in `factory.py:validate_ccpair_for_user`
still runs its own `validate_connector_settings`/`validate_perm_sync` calls and
separately feeds a coarse pass/fail report into the same
`credential_capability_report` table via
`capability_checks/recorder.py:record_blocking_validation_outcome`, which
never clobbers a richer report the check-runner already wrote.

For a source with named checks, a pairing at creation or credential swap
(`CapabilityCheckTrigger.CC_PAIR_VALIDATION`) skips the legacy
`validate_connector_settings`/`validate_perm_sync` calls.
`capability_checks/creation.py:validate_pairing_with_named_checks` runs the named
checks instead and stores the full report. Only a required check that `FAILED`
within the blocking budget blocks the pairing. Indexing and perm-sync attempts keep
the legacy validation. Full runs execute as the `RUN_CAPABILITY_CHECKS` Celery task
on the `capability_checks` queue. A beat task, `CHECK_FOR_STALE_CAPABILITY_RUNS`,
retires dead runs. Draft runs on an unsaved form (`/admin/connector-checks/runs`)
reuse their result at creation when the form is unchanged. The plan endpoint
(`/admin/connector-checks/plan`) lists the same checks without a credential or a
run, so the form can tell which checks exist and which are required first.

With `CONNECTOR_CHECKS_ENABLED`, a pair's first index attempt waits while a check
run is in flight or fails to run, or while a required check has `FAILED`
(`capability_checks/indexing_hold.py:get_first_indexing_hold`). See
[[indexing-pipeline]] §4.2.

### 4.9 Typed configs and credential families

Every registry entry has a `ConnectorConfig` (`connector_config.py`). Each field
mirrors one `__init__` kwarg of the connector. A config may inherit a
`CredentialBinding` model for fields whose valid values depend on the account behind
the credential, such as a site URL. `factory.py:validate_credential_binding` checks
those fields at pairing and on config edit.

`credential_families.py` lets related sources share one stored credential: Atlassian
(Confluence, Jira), Google (Gmail, Drive), and Microsoft (SharePoint, OneDrive,
Outlook, Teams). Each source has a `FamilyCredentialCodec`.
`to_source_credential_json` converts the family shape back to the source's own keys,
so a connector reads only its own keys. Credentials created before a source joined a
family keep the source's shape and stay usable by that source only.

---

## 5. Contracts and invariants

1. **`Document.id` must be stable across runs.** It is the dedup key against
   `DocumentByConnectorCredentialPair`. A connector that regenerates IDs (for
   example from a mutable field) creates duplicate documents on every run.
2. **A poll or checkpointed connector must honour its `start`/`end` window.**
   `ConnectorRunner.run` passes UNIX timestamps computed from the scheduling
   layer; a connector that ignores them either reprocesses everything every
   run or misses documents changed between runs.
3. **A slim connector must return exactly the same ID set as the full
   connector**, modulo the time window. Pruning's diff (§4.5) treats any ID
   present in the index but absent from the slim result as deleted at the
   source.
4. **Checkpoints must be JSON-serializable and resumable.**
   `ConnectorCheckpoint` subclasses are Pydantic models; `validate_checkpoint_json`
   must round-trip whatever `load_from_checkpoint` returns. `build_dummy_checkpoint`
   must produce a checkpoint with `has_more=True` so a fresh run actually starts.
5. **A connector must not swallow an auth failure as an empty result.**
   **Verified true, and unguarded at the framework level.** The pruning diff
   in §4.5 has no minimum-count or ratio check: if `extract_ids_from_runnable_connector`
   (`backend/onyx/background/celery/celery_utils.py`) returns a genuinely empty
   dict without raising, `connector_pruning_generator_task`
   (`backend/onyx/background/celery/tasks/pruning/tasks.py`) computes
   `doc_ids_to_remove` as every currently-indexed document for the cc-pair and
   proceeds to delete them. The framework's only protection is that an
   *exception* during slim retrieval aborts the run
   (`connector_pruning_generator_task`'s outer `except Exception` calls
   `set_failure_backoff` and re-raises, deleting nothing). Whether a given
   connector is safe depends entirely on whether its `retrieve_all_slim_docs*`
   implementation raises on a 401/403 rather than catching it and returning
   early. This is the highest-consequence contract in this component: a new
   connector's slim path must raise, not return empty, on auth failure.
6. **`include_attachments` parity between the main and slim passes.** Per
   `backend/onyx/connectors/README.md`, the slim pass must admit exactly the
   documents the main pass would index. Emitting attachment slim-doc IDs the
   main pass skips leaves permanent `chunk_count IS NULL` rows; omitting them
   incorrectly blocks pruning from cleaning up attachments after the setting
   is turned off.
7. **A `DocumentSource` value needs a matching `registry.py` entry**, or
   `factory.py:_load_connector_class` raises `ConnectorMissingException` the
   first time anyone tries to run it, not when the enum value is added.
8. **A `SourceOperations` subclass may not override `__init__`** and every
   public method on it must carry `@source_operation`; `__init_subclass__`
   enforces both at import time.
9. **`CredentialsConnector` and `load_credentials` are mutually exclusive in
   practice.** `factory.py:instantiate_connector` picks one path via
   `isinstance`. A connector that implements `CredentialsConnector` should make
   `load_credentials` raise (as Confluence and Slack do), so a caller cannot
   accidentally reach the wrong path.

## 6. Relationships

**Depends on**
- [[cc-pairs-and-credentials]]: owns `Connector`, `Credential`, and
  `ConnectorCredentialPair`; this component only reads
  `connector_specific_config` and decrypted credential JSON at run time.
- [[file-store-and-user-files]]: `RawFileCallback` staging for attachments and
  the tabular/CSV staging path in `cross_connector_utils/tabular_section_utils.py`.
  `backend/onyx/file_processing/extract_file_text.py:extract_text_and_images`
  is where a connector hands off a raw file for parsing into
  `TextSection`/`ImageSection` content.
- [[background-jobs]]: every fetch, prune, hierarchy-fetch, and targeted-reindex
  run is a Celery task driving this component's interfaces.
- [[access-control]]: `ExternalAccess` is defined and consumed there; a
  connector only produces the value.

**Depended on by**
- [[indexing-pipeline]]: the sole consumer of the `Document`/`HierarchyNode`/
  `ConnectorFailure` batches `ConnectorRunner` yields.
- [[permission-sync]]: EE perm-sync jobs drive `SlimConnectorWithPermSync` and
  `CheckpointedConnectorWithPermSync`, and reuse `SourceOperations` gateways
  (Slack, Outlook) for permission API calls.
- [[document-index]]: indirectly, through the documents this component
  supplies to indexing.
- [[federated-search]]: `FederatedConnectorSource` maps a federated pseudo-source
  back to the `DocumentSource` whose connector code (Slack) it partially reuses.

## 7. Blast radius

| If your change... | Also check |
|---|---|
| adds a new connector | `DocumentSource` enum, `registry.py:CONNECTOR_CLASS_MAP`, the class itself, `web/src/lib/connectors/connectors.tsx` (`connectorConfigs`), `web/src/lib/sources.ts` (`SOURCE_METADATA_MAP`), a folder under `backend/tests/daily/connectors/`, and (if attachments exist) the `include_attachments` gating on both the main and slim pass |
| changes the `Document`/`Section`/`SlimDocument` model | every connector that constructs one directly (no central factory does this for them); [[indexing-pipeline]]'s consumption of the new/changed field; the dedup logic keyed on `Document.id` and `content_hash` |
| changes `interfaces.py` (adds/renames a base class or method) | `factory.py:_validate_connector_supports_input_type` and `identify_connector_class`; `connector_runner.py`'s `isinstance` branches; every connector implementing the affected interface |
| changes checkpoint serialization (`ConnectorCheckpoint` or a subclass) | `validate_checkpoint_json` for that connector; any in-flight, persisted checkpoint from a prior run becomes unreadable, which [[indexing-pipeline]]'s resume logic must handle |
| changes `capabilities.py` or the `CredentialCapability` enum | `capability_checks/applicability.py`, `registry.py`, `runner.py`, and the `credential_capability_report` schema; the admin UI surface that reads capability reports |
| changes `source_operations.py`'s decorator or `SourceOperations` base | every existing gateway (`slack`, `confluence`, `onedrive`, `outlook` `source_operations.py`) and the import-fence test guarding SDK imports |
| changes pruning's diff logic | the invariant in §5.5; verify a connector auth failure still raises rather than producing an empty slim result |
| touches `credentials_provider.py` | the Redis lock TTL and rotation semantics for every `CredentialsConnector`; static-credential paths used by daily tests |

## 8. How to verify a change

### Tests

```bash
# One directory per source; this is the primary way a connector is tested
uv run pytest backend/tests/daily/connectors/confluence/

# Isolated, mockable logic only (rare for connectors)
uv run pytest backend/tests/unit -k connector

# External-dependency unit tests: real Postgres/Redis/OpenSearch, connector
# instantiated directly, selective mocking of the source API
uv run --env-file .vscode/.env pytest backend/tests/external_dependency_unit/connectors
```

Daily connector tests (`backend/tests/daily/connectors/<source>/`) declare real
credential requirements with `@pytest.mark.secrets(TestSecret.X)` (see
`backend/tests/daily/connectors/confluence/test_confluence_basic.py`), resolved
by `backend/tests/utils/aws_secrets.py` in order: process env vars, the
gitignored `.vscode/.env`, then AWS Secrets Manager. Root `AGENTS.md` and
`backend/CLAUDE.md` are authoritative on this mechanism; do not skip a test for
lack of a key, ask instead. The shared helper
`backend/tests/daily/connectors/utils.py:load_all_from_connector` drives
`load_from_checkpoint`/`load_from_checkpoint_with_perm_sync` and returns the
`Document` list a test asserts against.

### Manual reproduction

1. Confirm services are up: `tail -f backend/log/api_server_debug.log`.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/admin/connectors`, sign in as
   `admin_user@example.com` / `TestPassword123!`.
3. Add a connector for a source you changed, watch it move through indexing to
   a document count on the connector status page.
4. Confirm the documents are searchable in chat.
5. If you touched pruning or slim logic: delete a document at the source,
   trigger a prune run, confirm the document disappears from the index and not
   more than that document.

### What "working" looks like

- No `ConnectorMissingException` at run time for a source with a registry entry.
- Index count matches the source's actual document count after a full run.
- A prune run removes only documents actually deleted at the source.
- A resumed checkpointed run does not reprocess documents from before the
  checkpoint, and does not skip documents added after it.

## 9. Footguns

- **`DocumentFailure.document_id` must equal the `Document.id` the connector
  indexes, not a source-native id.** The internal producer
  (`indexing/indexing_pipeline.py`, `DocumentFailure(document_id=document.id)`)
  sets the convention, and three consumers compare it directly against
  `Document.id`: `background/celery/tasks/docprocessing/tasks.py`
  (`document.id not in failed_document_ids`),
  `background/indexing/run_targeted_reindex.py` (`{d.id for d in documents} -
  failed_ids`), and `background/celery/celery_utils.py:_get_failure_id` (pruning
  preservation). Every connector follows it (#14962): for example Confluence
  passes `page_url`, GitHub `html_url`, Jira `build_jira_url(...)`, and Zendesk
  `article:{id}` / `zendesk_ticket_{id}`. A mismatched id breaks targeted reindex:
  Confluence's `reindex` extracts the page id from a URL, so a bare numeric id can
  never be repaired. Gong and SharePoint pass `"unknown"` only when the source
  returns no id at all. Copy an existing connector's failure site when you add
  one.
- **The pruning framework trusts the connector to raise on auth failure.**
  There is no zero-count safety net (§5.5). A connector that catches a 401 and
  returns an empty generator will look, to pruning, exactly like "the source
  deleted everything."
- **`InputType.EVENT` is rejected for every connector.** `factory.py` raises when a connector is built with `InputType.EVENT`, so no event-driven path exists.
- **A missing `registry.py` entry only fails at first use**, not at import
  time or when the `DocumentSource` enum value is added, so a half-finished
  connector can sit invisible until someone tries to run it.
- **`load_credentials` and `set_credentials_provider` look like two optional
  hooks but are meant to be exclusive.** Confluence and Slack make this
  explicit by raising `NotImplementedError` in `load_credentials`. A connector
  that implements both silently picks whichever `factory.py`'s `isinstance`
  check favors (`CredentialsConnector` wins).
- **Checkpoint shape varies enormously.** `GoogleDriveCheckpoint` is a
  multi-stage state machine with a per-user completion map, not a cursor. Do
  not assume a checkpoint is small or simple when reasoning about serialization
  changes.
- **`SourceOperations` is opt-in and mostly unused.** Only Slack, Confluence,
  OneDrive, and Outlook have a gateway; most connectors still make source-API calls inline, so the
  "one file that talks to the source" guarantee only holds for those four today.
- **`include_attachments` default differs by connector age.** New connectors
  default to `False`; connectors retrofitted with the flag default to `True`
  to preserve existing behavior for connector rows that predate the setting.
  Copying a default from the wrong kind of connector silently changes behavior
  for existing users.
