# Craft Webapp Proxy

> Lets a user watch the web app their Craft session is building, live, inside
> Onyx. It proxies HTTP and one websocket into the sandbox's Next.js dev
> server, and it is the trust boundary between the sandbox and the viewer's
> browser.

**Verified against:** `268e4d5a3d` (2026-10-05)
**Domain:** craft
**Edition:** CE (Craft ships in both editions; no EE-specific code in this path)
**Owns:**
`backend/onyx/server/features/build/webapp_proxy.py`,
`backend/onyx/server/features/build/sandbox/nextjs_dev.py`,
`web/src/app/craft/components/output-panel/PreviewTab.tsx`,
`web/src/app/craft/components/OutputPanel.tsx`

**Read first:** `docs/craft/lazy-webapp-provisioning.md`. It is the design
plan for on-demand dev-server startup and the tamper-hardened bootstrap
script this document's provisioning section maps to code.

## 1. What the user experiences

A user asks Craft to build a web app. As the agent writes code, a Preview tab
in the session view shows the running app in an iframe, hot-reloading as the
agent edits files. The user never runs a command to see this; the dev server
starts the first time the agent (or the user, via a documented fallback
script) needs it.

Only the session owner can load the Preview tab, because `get_webapp_info`
verifies ownership. The proxy also admits any authenticated tenant user who
knows the proxy URL when the sharing scope is `PUBLIC_ORG`. A logged-in viewer
without access gets a 404, not a broken frame.
A logged-out viewer is redirected to `/auth/login`.

---

## 2. Surfaces

### HTTP and websocket endpoints (router prefix `/build`, `webapp_proxy.py`)

| Method | Path | Handler | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/build/sessions/{session_id}/webapp` and `/build/sessions/{session_id}/webapp/{path:path}` | `get_webapp` | Proxies to the session's Next.js dev server. Public endpoint spec (exempt from the global auth middleware); auth is enforced inside the handler. |
| WS | `/build/sessions/{session_id}/webapp/_next/{hmr_endpoint}` | `websocket_webapp_hmr` | Proxies `hmr` and `webpack-hmr` through the same authenticated handler. |

`backend/onyx/server/features/build/session/api.py:get_webapp_info` (GET
`/build/sessions/{session_id}/webapp-info`) is a separate, authenticated
endpoint that reports `has_webapp`, `webapp_url`, and `ready`; the frontend
polls it to decide when to show the Preview tab and what iframe URL to pass
it (`web/src/app/craft/components/OutputPanel.tsx`).

### Cache keys (`webapp_proxy.py`)

| Key | TTL | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `craft:webapp:url:{session_id}` | 60 s | Cached sandbox base URL, so a hot proxy path skips a DB round trip. |
| `craft:webapp:access:{session_id}:{user_id}` | 30 s | Cached "this user may view this session's webapp" grant. Only grants are cached; a 404 or 401 always re-checks. |

Both live in the configured `CacheBackend` (`get_cache_backend`: Redis, or
PostgreSQL when `CACHE_BACKEND=postgres`). They are shared by all API server
replicas, so the cache is consistent across them.

---

## 3. Data model

This component reads but does not own session state. `[[craft-sessions]]`
owns the `BuildSession` row this proxy resolves through
(`get_webapp_target_async`, `get_webapp_access_async` in
`onyx/server/features/build/db/build_session.py`): the session's
`sharing_scope`, owner id, sandbox id, and allocated `nextjs_port`.

`[[craft-sandboxes]]` owns the sandbox itself and the port allocation
(`SANDBOX_NEXTJS_PORT_START`/`_END`, `reserve_nextjs_port__no_commit`).

---

## 4. How it works

### 4.1 Resolving the target

`_get_sandbox_url` (`webapp_proxy.py`) resolves a session to a base URL:

1. Check the cache backend (`craft:webapp:url:{session_id}`).
2. On a miss, load `(sandbox_id, nextjs_port)` via
   `get_webapp_target_async`. Missing session, unallocated port, or missing
   sandbox each raise a distinct HTTP error (404, 503, 404).
3. Call `get_sandbox_manager().get_webapp_url(sandbox_id, nextjs_port)`.
   On Kubernetes this returns an in-cluster service URL,
   `http://{pod_name}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local:{port}`
   (`kubernetes_sandbox_manager.py:_get_nextjs_url`, called from
   `get_webapp_url`). The URL is never reachable from outside the cluster
   except through this proxy.
4. Cache the resolved URL for 60 seconds.

### 4.2 Authorizing the viewer

`_check_webapp_access` (`webapp_proxy.py`) runs before every proxied request
and before the websocket is accepted:

1. If the viewer has a cached grant for this session, allow immediately.
2. Otherwise load `(sharing_scope, owner_id)` via `get_webapp_access_async`.
   Missing session: 404. No authenticated user: 401 on the HTTP path (the
   route handler turns that into a redirect to `/auth/login`, since a
   preview iframe or top-level navigation should not just render a bare
   401 page); the websocket path raises `WebSocketException(code=1008)`
   directly, since a websocket handshake has no redirect.
3. `SharingScope` has two values. `PRIVATE` (the column default) admits only
   the owner. `PUBLIC_ORG` (the "Organization" option in `ShareButton.tsx`)
   admits any authenticated user in the tenant, by design. The DB session and
   the cache are both tenant-scoped, so no grant crosses tenants.
4. A grant is cached for 30 seconds so a burst of asset requests for one
   page load does not re-hit the database per file. The cache key is per
   viewer, so `set_build_session_sharing_scope` does not evict it: a viewer
   who already loaded a `PUBLIC_ORG` preview keeps access for up to 30
   seconds after the owner sets it back to `PRIVATE`.

**The security answer:** a preview is reachable by the session owner,
or by any other authenticated tenant user while the sharing scope is not
`PRIVATE`. A cached grant can stay valid for up to 30 seconds after the scope
changes back to `PRIVATE`. There is no separate "preview link" credential. `PUBLIC_ORG`
grants access to the live app only. Transcript and session routes still
require session ownership (`db/build_session.py:get_build_session`). A
logged-in viewer without the right sharing scope gets a 404. An authenticated non-owner
cannot distinguish "session does not exist" from "session exists but is
private." An unauthenticated viewer can: a missing session returns 404, and
an existing session returns a redirect to `/auth/login`.

### 4.3 Proxying a request

`_proxy_request` builds the upstream path with `_webapp_next_path`, which
prefixes every request with the session's base path,
`webapp_base_path(session_id)` = `/api/build/sessions/{session_id}/webapp`
(`sandbox/nextjs_dev.py:webapp_base_path`). Next.js's dev server is started
configured with that same base path (`ONYX_WEBAPP_BASE_PATH`, see §4.5), so
responses pass through unmodified: no URL rewriting, no HTML injection to
patch relative links.

Request headers are filtered through `EXCLUDED_REQUEST_HEADERS`
(`webapp_proxy.py`) before forwarding: the viewer's Onyx cookie,
`Authorization`, CSRF tokens, and the explicitly listed client-identity
headers (`forwarded`, named `x-forwarded-*` headers, `x-real-ip`,
`cf-connecting-ip`, and the IDP user and email headers) are stripped. The
filter also drops every `x-onyx-*` and `sec-fetch-*` header by prefix. A
header that is in neither list reaches the sandbox. The sandbox runs LLM-generated code; it must never see the
viewer's Onyx credentials. Response headers are filtered through
`EXCLUDED_HEADERS`: hop-by-hop headers are dropped, and `set-cookie` is
stripped so app code running in the sandbox cannot set a cookie on the
parent Onyx domain.

On a proxy-level failure (502/503/504), the handler evicts the cached
sandbox URL (it may point at a dead or recreated pod) and returns a
friendly offline page (`templates/webapp_offline.html`) instead of a raw
gateway error.

### 4.4 Proxying the HMR websocket

`websocket_webapp_hmr` requires an authenticated user
(`current_user_from_websocket_cookie`, `onyx/auth/users.py`). That dependency
checks the websocket origin and reads the session cookie. On multi-tenant
deployments it resolves the tenant from the session token in Redis and sets
the tenant context before it loads the user. It also requires
`Permission.BASIC_ACCESS`. The handler then runs the same access check, then
`_proxy_webapp_hmr_websocket` opens a second websocket to the sandbox's
`/_next/hmr` or `/_next/webpack-hmr` endpoint requested by the client and pumps messages both directions
(`_pump_webapp_to_upstream`, `_pump_upstream_to_webapp`) until either side
closes.

### 4.5 Lazy provisioning

The dev server does not start at session setup. `session_workspace.py`
writes a self-contained, `chmod 444` script, `start-webapp.sh`, built by
`build_webapp_bootstrap_script` (`sandbox/nextjs_dev.py`). The agent (via
the opencode `webapp` tool) or a documented `bash start-webapp.sh` fallback
runs it the first time a web app is actually being built:

1. Scaffold `outputs/web` from the template if `outputs/web/package.json`
   is missing, then `bun install`.
2. `build_nextjs_start_script` writes the port to `.nextjs-port`, exports
   `ONYX_WEBAPP_PORT`, `ONYX_WEBAPP_BASE_PATH`, and
   `ONYX_WEBAPP_ALLOWED_DEV_ORIGINS` (`allowed_dev_origins`, derived from
   `WEB_DOMAIN`, satisfies Next 16's `allowedDevOrigins` cross-origin
   check), then starts `bun run dev` under `flock` so a concurrent replay
   cannot spawn a second server for the same session
   (`sandbox/nextjs_dev.py:build_nextjs_start_script`).
3. On snapshot restore, `build_webapp_restore_script` rewrites the script
   with the re-allocated port and auto-starts it only if the restored
   snapshot's `outputs/web/package.json` exists
   (`kubernetes_sandbox_manager.py` `restore_snapshot`).

Port allocation is per-user and per-session: `reserve_nextjs_port__no_commit`
(`db/build_session.py`) allocates one port from
`[SANDBOX_NEXTJS_PORT_START, SANDBOX_NEXTJS_PORT_END)` for
`SessionOrigin.INTERACTIVE` sessions only, persisted on
`build_session.nextjs_port`. Headless sessions (scheduled-task fires; see
`[[craft-scheduled-tasks]]`) get `nextjs_port=None` and skip webapp
provisioning entirely, since nothing will view them live.

### Artifact preview refresh

`FilePreviewContent.tsx` accepts file revisions and explicit reload counters.
It shares one viewer implementation between full-height and inline previews.
Inactive viewers defer revision changes until activation.

Each mounted file viewer owns a private SWR cache with one current payload.
`web/src/lib/build/hooks.ts:useFilePreview` owns revision-aware payload replacement.
File revisions and explicit reloads replace that payload. Mounted viewers reuse
unchanged data. Unmounting a viewer releases its cache; remounting fetches fresh
bytes. SWR retries failed requests and rejects superseded responses. Viewers show
only results and errors for their accepted revision and reload counter. Cache misses and reloads bypass the
browser cache when fetching artifacts. PDF object URLs are revoked when replaced
or when their viewer unmounts.

PowerPoint previews use LibreOffice and PDF rasterization to produce slide images.
A vertical thumbnail column supports click and keyboard navigation, marks the
selected slide, and scrolls it into view. Thumbnail images load lazily.
Keyboard navigation only handles events within the slide toolbar.
Inactive presentations ignore keyboard navigation. Closed output panels are inert,
so their controls cannot receive focus or keyboard input.

## 5. Contracts and invariants

1. **A preview must only be reachable by someone entitled to that session.**
   `_check_webapp_access` must run before every proxied HTTP request and
   before the HMR websocket is accepted. A new route added to this router
   without that check is a direct information leak into a user's sandbox.
2. **The sandbox must never receive the viewer's Onyx credentials.**
   `EXCLUDED_REQUEST_HEADERS` strips cookies, `Authorization`, CSRF tokens,
   and the listed identity headers before every forwarded request. A new header the
   sandbox should not see must be added there, not assumed absent.
3. **The proxy must not cache content-volatile dev assets.** Only
   `_next/static/media/*` is content-hashed and safe to cache immutably;
   everything else, including JS chunks and CSS, is stable-URL-but-mutable
   in dev and must pass through uncached (`_proxy_request`, §9).
4. **`set-cookie` from the sandbox must never reach the viewer's browser
   under the Onyx origin.** Stripped unconditionally in `EXCLUDED_HEADERS`.
5. **The base path must match on both ends.** `webapp_base_path(session_id)`
   is used by the proxy's upstream path construction, the start script's
   `ONYX_WEBAPP_BASE_PATH`, and the template `next.config.ts`. A change to
   one without the others breaks every asset URL Next.js emits.

---

## 6. Relationships

**Depends on**
- [[craft-sessions]]: session ownership, sharing scope, and the
  `nextjs_port` field this proxy resolves through.
- [[craft-sandboxes]]: the sandbox manager that turns a `(sandbox_id, port)`
  pair into a reachable URL, and that runs the bootstrap/restore scripts.
- [[auth-and-identity]]: `optional_user`, `current_user_from_websocket_cookie`.
- [[multi-tenancy]]: sessions and sandboxes are tenant-scoped. The HTTP path
  gets its tenant from the request middleware. The websocket path has no
  such middleware, so `current_user_from_websocket_cookie` sets the tenant
  context itself from the session token.

**Depended on by**
- [[craft-external-apps]]: unrelated egress path, but shares the theme of
  "the sandbox is untrusted and must be firewalled from Onyx credentials."
- [[craft-scheduled-tasks]]: scheduled (headless) sessions deliberately skip
  this component; `nextjs_port` stays `None` for them.

## 7. Blast radius

| If your change... | Also check |
|---|---|
| adds a new proxied path or method | `EXCLUDED_REQUEST_HEADERS`/`EXCLUDED_HEADERS` still apply; `_check_webapp_access` still runs first |
| changes what is cached or its TTL | the cache-eviction-on-502/503/504 path in `get_webapp`, and whether a stale grant could outlive a sharing-scope change |
| changes `webapp_base_path` | `nextjs_dev.py`'s start script, the template `next.config.ts`, and every place `_webapp_next_path` builds an upstream path |
| changes port allocation | `[[craft-sandboxes]]`, and whether headless (scheduled) sessions still correctly skip provisioning |
| touches the HMR websocket proxy | verify hydration still works; this is the trap in §9, and it fails silently, not loudly |
| changes response header filtering | re-check `set-cookie` stripping and cache-control handling together; a change to one filter can undo the other's intent |

## 8. How to verify a change

### Tests

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/onyx/server/features/craft/test_webapp_proxy_header_stripping.py
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/onyx/server/features/craft/session/test_webapp_info.py
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/external_dependency_unit/craft/test_webapp_hmr_websocket_auth.py
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/integration/tests/craft/test_webapp_proxy.py
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/integration/tests/craft/k8s/test_webapp_preview.py
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/integration/tests/craft/docker_e2e/test_webapp_preview_docker.py
```

Use manual reproduction for the cache and hot-reload behaviour below.

### Manual reproduction

1. Confirm services are up: `tail -f backend/log/api_server_debug.log`.
2. In a Craft session, ask the agent to scaffold a simple Next.js page.
3. Open the Preview tab. Confirm the app renders and that editing a
   component (ask the agent to change some visible text) hot-reloads
   without a manual refresh. If it renders once but never updates after an
   edit, the HMR websocket is not reaching the sandbox; check
   `_next/hmr` (or `_next/webpack-hmr`) in the browser's network panel for a failed
   upgrade.
4. Open the same session URL as a second, unrelated user account (or in an
   incognito window with no session). Confirm the second user gets a 404
   and the logged-out window is redirected to `/auth/login`, not rendered.
5. Edit a file that changes a CSS class or a JS chunk's content, then
   reload the preview without restarting the dev server. Confirm the new
   styling/behavior shows immediately, not a stale cached version.

Drive the browser with `claude-in-chrome` against the user's real Chrome.

### What "working" looks like

- An unauthorized logged-in viewer gets a 404 and a logged-out viewer gets a
  redirect to `/auth/login`. Neither sees a rendered frame.
- Hot reload works after a file edit without a manual page reload.
- No stale JS/CSS after an edit, confirmed by a hard content check, not
  just "the page still looks fine."

---

## 9. Footguns

- **Websocket upgrade is required for hydration, and failing to provide it
  does not look like an error.** Next.js 16 with Turbopack and React 19
  needs its HMR websocket connected for the page to
  hydrate correctly in dev. If a deployment's proxy or ingress fails to
  upgrade that connection, the page still renders (the initial HTML and
  JS load fine over plain HTTP), but no event handlers attach: dropdowns
  don't open, buttons don't respond. This looks like a broken feature in
  the generated app, not a proxy problem. `websocket_webapp_hmr`
  (`webapp_proxy.py`) is confirmed to implement the upgrade and pump both
  directions; a regression here would reproduce exactly this symptom.
- **Next.js HMR paths vary by version.** Newer sandbox apps use `/_next/hmr`; older apps use `/_next/webpack-hmr`. Both the frontend development rewrite and backend WebSocket route must preserve the requested endpoint. Missing the new path leaves server-rendered headers visible while client components never initialize.
- **Only `_next/static/media/*` is safe to cache immutably.** `_proxy_request`
  checks `rel_path.startswith("_next/static/media/")` before setting
  `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; every other path,
  including dev JS chunks and CSS, is passed through with whatever
  cache-control Next.js's dev server itself sets. Dev chunk and CSS URLs
  are stable in shape but their content changes as the agent edits files,
  so caching them would serve stale code after an edit that looks
  unrelated to caching at all.
- **The upstream base URL is an internal cluster address, not a public
  one.** `get_webapp_url` on Kubernetes returns a
  `*.svc.cluster.local` URL. This proxy is the only path a browser can use
  to reach it; there is no direct-to-pod fallback for a viewer.
- **PowerPoint replacements can preserve modification time.** The converter reuses cached slides only when they are newer than the source modification and change times. This detects same-size replacements without hashing file contents.
