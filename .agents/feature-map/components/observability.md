## 1. What the user experiences

An operator scrapes `GET /metrics` on the API server, the MCP server, and each
Celery worker's standalone metrics port, and wires the results into Grafana.
No dashboard ships in-product; `docs/METRICS.md` documents every metric and
gives PromQL starting points.

An admin connects Braintrust or Langfuse under **Admin > Tracing**
(`web/src/app/admin/tracing/page.tsx`), pastes an API key, and sees every
tagged LLM call as a trace with model, provider, tokens, and (unless masked or
incognito) the actual prompt and response. `Admin > System Info`
(`web/src/app/admin/systeminfo/page.tsx`) shows only build versions, not
metrics.

A user sees their own token/cost usage on a Usage tab
(`GET /user/usage`, `server/features/usage/api.py:get_my_usage`). An admin sees
company-wide usage broken out by user (`GET /admin/usage/export`) and by
non-user system flows such as contextual RAG (`GET /admin/usage/system`), can
reset a user's usage window, and can request a downloadable usage report ZIP
(`ee/onyx/background/celery/tasks/usage_reporting/tasks.py:generate_usage_report_task`)
containing per-user and per-system CSVs plus a PDF summary (see
`docs/usage/usage-reports.md`).

An admin with the right permission also reviews **Query History**
(`ee/onyx/server/query_history/api.py`) for chat-session-level audit and
exports it, downloads a **log export** bundle of raw log files for support or
compliance (`ee/onyx/server/log_export/api.py`), and reads security-relevant
events (login, permission changes, credential access) as JSON lines on the
`onyx.audit` logger tree, shipped to whatever SIEM the operator points a log
shipper at (`docs/AUDIT_LOGGING.md`).

An admin can also register an **outbound hook**: an HTTPS endpoint Onyx calls
synchronously at a fixed point in a pipeline (document ingestion, document
push, or query processing) and waits on for a response, configurable at
**Admin > Hooks** (`ee/onyx/server/features/hooks/api.py`).

## 2. Surfaces

### Metrics

| Surface | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /metrics` (API server) | Bearer token | `server/metrics/prometheus_setup.py:expose_prometheus_metrics`, guarded by `metrics_auth.py:verify_metrics_token`. |
| `GET /metrics` (MCP server) | Bearer token | Same auth dependency, separate process. |
| Celery worker metrics port | None (network-level only) | `metrics_server.py:start_metrics_server`; per-worker default ports (docfetching 9092, docprocessing 9093, monitoring 9096, heavy 9094, light 9095, primary 9097, scheduled_tasks 9098). |

### Tracing admin endpoints (`server/manage/tracing/api.py`, prefix `/admin/tracing`)

| Method | Path | Handler |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/admin/tracing/providers` | `list_tracing_providers` |
| POST | `/admin/tracing/providers` | `upsert_tracing_provider_endpoint` |
| DELETE | `/admin/tracing/providers/{provider_type}` | `disconnect_tracing_provider` |
| POST | `/admin/tracing/providers/test` | `test_tracing_provider` |
| POST | `/admin/tracing/providers/{provider_type}/adopt-env` | `adopt_env_tracing_provider` |

Every route in this router carries `Depends(_reject_if_multi_tenant)`
(`server/manage/tracing/api.py`); see §5 and §9.

### Usage endpoints (`server/features/usage/api.py`)

| Method | Path | Handler | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/user/usage` | `get_my_usage` | Caller's own token/cost usage and budget. |
| GET | `/admin/usage/export` | `export_usage` | Company-wide usage by user email. |
| GET | `/admin/usage/system` | `get_system_usage` | Non-user (system-attributed) usage, e.g. contextual RAG. |
| POST | `/admin/usage/reset` | `reset_usage` | Clears one user's usage across every active rate-limit window. |
| GET/PUT/DELETE | `/admin/cost-overrides` | `list_cost_overrides`, `upsert_cost_override`, `delete_cost_override` | Per-model price overrides used by cost computation. |

### Hooks endpoints (`ee/onyx/server/features/hooks/api.py`, prefix `/admin/hooks`)

`GET /admin/hooks/specs`, `GET|POST /admin/hooks`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /admin/hooks/{hook_id}`,
`POST /admin/hooks/{hook_id}/activate`, `.../deactivate`, `.../validate`,
`GET /admin/hooks/{hook_id}/execution-logs`.

### Query history and log export (EE)

`ee/onyx/server/query_history/api.py`: `GET /admin/chat-sessions`,
`GET /admin/chat-session-history`, `GET /admin/chat-session-history/{id}`,
`GET /admin/query-history/list`, `POST /admin/query-history/start-export`,
`GET /admin/query-history/export-status`, `GET /admin/query-history/download`.

`ee/onyx/server/log_export/api.py`: `POST /admin/log-export`,
`GET /admin/log-export/{export_id}`, `GET /admin/log-export/{export_id}/download`.

### Environment configuration

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN` | unset | Required bearer token for `/metrics`. |
| `DISABLE_METRICS_AUTH` | `false` | Deliberately exposes `/metrics` with no auth. |
| `PROMETHEUS_METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Set `false` to disable a worker's standalone metrics server. |
| `PROMETHEUS_METRICS_PORT` | per-worker default | Overrides the worker's metrics port. |
| `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_SECONDS` | `1.0` | Threshold for `onyx_api_slow_requests_total`. |
| `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY`, `BRAINTRUST_PROJECT`, `BRAINTRUST_API_URL` | `""`, `"Onyx"`, `""` | Env fallback for Braintrust when no DB row exists. |
| `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_HOST` | `""` | Env fallback for Langfuse. |
| `TRACING_CONFIG_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `30` | Re-read interval for the effective tracing config. |
| `USER_USAGE_TRACKING_ENABLED` | `true` | Gates the per-user usage recording processor. Independent of Braintrust/Langfuse. |
| `MULTI_TENANT` | | Forces tracing config to env-only and blocks `/admin/tracing/*`. |

---

## 3. Data model

- **`TracingProviderConfig`** (`db/models.py`, via `db/tracing.py`): one row per
  tracing provider (`provider_type`, `enabled`, encrypted `api_key`, `config`
  JSONB). Read/written by `db/tracing.py:fetch_tracing_provider`,
  `upsert_tracing_provider`, `delete_tracing_provider`.
- **`UserUsage`** (`db/models.py`): the per-actor, per-day, per-model/flow/provider
  usage rollup. `user_id` is nullable; `actor_kind` (`UsageActorKind`) and
  `system_attribution` (`SystemUsageAttribution`) distinguish a real user row
  from a system-attributed row (e.g. contextual RAG). `incognito` is a
  dedicated boolean column: an incognito turn's spend accumulates in its own
  row so reporting can separate it, per `db/models.py:UserUsage`.
- **`TenantUsage`** (`db/models.py`, via `db/usage.py`): the cloud usage-limit
  ledger, one row per rolling window (`llm_cost_cents`, `chunks_indexed`,
  `api_calls`, `non_streaming_api_calls`). This is a different concern from
  `UserUsage`: see §4.6.
- **`LLMUsageRecord`** (`db/llm_usage.py`): a Pydantic value object, not a
  table. It carries one aggregated usage sample (`model`, `flow`, `provider`,
  token counts, `cost_cents`, `window_start`) into `record_user_usage` /
  `record_system_usage`, which upsert it into `UserUsage` via
  `db/llm_usage.py:build_usage_upsert_values` (additive merge on conflict, not
  overwrite).
- **`Hook`** and **`HookExecutionLog`** (`db/models.py`): a hook row (`name`,
  `hook_point`, `endpoint_url`, encrypted `api_key`, `fail_strategy`,
  `timeout_seconds`, `is_active`, `is_reachable`, soft-deleted via `deleted`)
  and its failure log (`db/hook.py`). At most one non-deleted hook per
  `HookPoint` (`db/hook.py:create_hook__no_commit`).
- Audit events are **not** a table. They are JSON-serialized log lines on the
  `onyx.audit` logger tree (`utils/audit.py`); there is no `audit_event` table
  yet (`docs/AUDIT_LOGGING.md` calls this a planned follow-up).

---

## 4. How it works

### 4.1 Prometheus metrics

`server/metrics/prometheus_setup.py:setup_prometheus_metrics` is called during
API-server startup. It registers `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` request
metrics (count, latency, in-progress gauge), the slow-request callback
(`slow_requests.py:slow_request_callback`), and the per-tenant callback
(`per_tenant.py:per_tenant_request_callback`), then exposes `/metrics` gated by
`metrics_auth.py:verify_metrics_token` as a FastAPI dependency. SQLAlchemy pool
metrics are registered separately, after the engines exist, via
`postgres_connection_pool.py:setup_postgres_connection_pool_metrics`.

Celery workers do not share the API server's `/metrics`. Each worker that
wants metrics calls `metrics_server.py:start_metrics_server(worker_type)` from
its `worker_ready` signal handler, which starts a standalone WSGI server on a
per-worker-type port (dual-stack IPv4/IPv6, no auth: it is meant to be scraped
inside the cluster network, not exposed externally). Generic per-task lifecycle
metrics come from `celery_task_metrics.py:on_celery_task_prerun` /
`on_celery_task_postrun` / `on_celery_task_retry` / `on_celery_task_revoked` /
`on_celery_task_rejected`, wired manually into each worker's own Celery signal
handlers; only `docfetching` and `docprocessing` currently do this
(`docs/METRICS.md` "Current Worker Integration Status").

### 4.2 Per-tenant labelling

`per_tenant.py:per_tenant_request_callback` reads
`shared_configs.contextvars.CURRENT_TENANT_ID_CONTEXTVAR` and increments
`onyx_api_requests_by_tenant_total{tenant_id,...}` on every request. This is
the model for any new HTTP-scoped metric in a multi-tenant deployment: without
a `tenant_id` label, a metric aggregates across every customer on the shared
cluster. Connector-state metrics take a different approach for the same
reason: `docs/METRICS.md` "Connector State Metrics" states that collection is
skipped entirely under multi-tenant, to avoid a cross-tenant snapshot read.

### 4.3 Tracing framework

`onyx/tracing/framework/` (`create.py`, `spans.py`, `traces.py`,
`span_data.py`, `provider.py`) is the underlying span/trace primitive:
`generation_span`, `agent_span`, `function_span` context managers, a
`TracingProcessor` interface (`processor_interface.py`), and a pluggable
processor list set via `set_trace_processors` / `add_trace_processor`.

`tracing/setup.py:setup_tracing()` registers exactly one processor at
startup, `dynamic_processor.py:DynamicTracingProcessor`, which is itself a
fan-out: on a TTL (`TRACING_CONFIG_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`), it calls
`provider_config.py:resolve_effective_tracing_config()` and rebuilds Braintrust
/ Langfuse delegate processors (`dynamic_processor.py:build_delegates`) if the
config's fingerprint changed. A delegate set is captured per in-flight trace
(`_trace_delegates`) so a config change never disrupts a trace already in
progress. If `USER_USAGE_TRACKING_ENABLED` is true, `setup_tracing` also
registers `tracing/processors/user_usage_processor.py:UserUsageTracingProcessor`
directly via `add_trace_processor`, independent of Braintrust/Langfuse.

### 4.4 The two instrumentation entry points

- `tracing/llm_utils.py:llm_generation_span(llm, flow, ...)`: for any call that
  goes through an `LLM` subclass. Pulls model and provider off `llm.config`.
- `tracing/llm_utils.py:traced_llm_call(flow, model, provider, ...)`: for
  direct provider-SDK or cross-process calls (image generation, voice,
  embeddings/rerank to `model_server`) that bypass `LLM` entirely.

Both build a `model_config` dict tagging `flow` (an `LLMFlow` value,
`tracing/flows.py`) and `model_provider`; `flows.py:LLMFlow` enumerates every
tagged operation, grouped by area (chat/agent, secondary LLM flows, Craft,
`LLM_GATEWAY`, indexing, image, voice, embeddings/rerank).
`[[llm-providers]]` covers the LLM-provider-side detail of resolution and
retries; this file covers what happens to a span once it is opened.

Chat generation spans also record the prompt-cache flag, prefix message count,
estimated prefix tokens, and history message count in `model_config`. On span
end, Langfuse exports these fields as generation metadata. This accepts any
non-null mapping, including read-only mappings.

### 4.5 The untagged fallback flows

`LitellmLLM.invoke` and `LitellmLLM.stream` (`onyx/llm/multi_llm.py`) open their
own generation span with `llm_generation_span`. The flow comes from
`GenerationContext.flow`. If the caller sets none, the span uses
`LLMFlow.UNTAGGED_INVOKE` or `LLMFlow.UNTAGGED_STREAM`. This is a safety net
so untagged calls still get *some* observability, not a substitute for
instrumentation: a dashboard showing either sentinel means a call site did
not set `GenerationContext.flow`. Direct callers of `invoke_raw`/`stream_raw`
open no span, so they must call `llm_generation_span` or `traced_llm_call`.
A span error goes through `LitellmLLM.redact_error` first, so credentials do not reach the trace backend.

### 4.6 Masking and incognito

**Masking** (`tracing/masking.py:mask_sensitive_data`) runs inside the
Braintrust delegate before content leaves the process:
`dynamic_processor.py:_build_braintrust_processor` calls
`braintrust.set_masking_function(mask_sensitive_data)`. It recursively:
redacts any dict key containing `"private_key"` or `"authorization"` to
`"***REDACTED***"`; redacts a string containing `"private_key"` entirely, or
an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` substring within a longer string (the token
only, via regex substitution); and truncates any string longer than
`MASKING_LENGTH` (default 500,000 chars, `TRACING_MASKING_LENGTH` env),
keeping the head and a small tail with a `[TRUNCATED ... ]` marker. Langfuse
has no equivalent masking hook in `langfuse_tracing_processor.py`: masking
today is Braintrust-specific.

**Incognito** is a separate, orthogonal guarantee.
`tracing/incognito.py:suppresses_external_traces()` reads the current
`IncognitoRecordMode` from `shared_configs.contextvars` and returns true when
that mode does not permit external traces. Both
`braintrust_tracing_processor.py` and `langfuse_tracing_processor.py` call
this at trace start and drop the whole trace (spans included) when true, so
**incognito content cannot reach Braintrust or Langfuse**. The per-user usage
processor is different again: `processors/user_usage_processor.py:_capture`
still records an incognito span's token counts and cost (labeled
`incognito=True` on the `UserUsage` row), because usage accounting is not an
external trace backend. See `[[chat-persistence]]` for how incognito content
is (not) persisted to `ChatMessage`.

### 4.7 Provider config resolution and cloud gating

`provider_config.py:resolve_effective_tracing_config()` prefers a DB
`TracingProviderConfig` row per provider (`_braintrust_from_row`,
`_langfuse_from_row`); a provider with no row, or a disabled row, falls back
to that provider's env vars. Under `MULTI_TENANT`, the DB is never read: only
env vars apply. `server/manage/tracing/api.py:_reject_if_multi_tenant` enforces
the same boundary at the endpoint level, rejecting every route under
`/admin/tracing` with `OnyxErrorCode.SINGLE_TENANT_ONLY` on cloud. Cloud
tracing configuration is therefore env-only end to end.

### 4.8 Audit logging

Audit events are emitted by `utils/audit.py:emit_audit_event` (and the older
`utils/credential_audit.py:emit_credential_access` for credential-decrypt
events) as `INFO` records on the `onyx.audit.*` logger tree, with the event
serialized to JSON in the message body so the line is byte-identical
regardless of `LOG_FORMAT`. Field shape and the `action` taxonomy (a stable,
append-only `<domain>.<verb>` contract) are defined in `docs/AUDIT_LOGGING.md`;
emission is fail-safe (never raises into the caller) and deduped via Redis for
high-volume classes, degrading to always-emit if Redis is unavailable. There is
no read API in Onyx today: the documented consumption path is an external log
shipper filtering on the `onyx.audit` logger prefix.

### 4.9 Usage and cost accounting

Two independent systems both live under "usage", and they answer different
questions:

- **LLM cost tracking** (`onyx/llm/cost.py`, surfaced via `UserUsage`): what a
  specific model call cost, computed per-token from the vendored price table (`llm/price_table/`), with
  admin-configurable overrides (`server/features/usage/api.py:upsert_cost_override`,
  backed by `llm/cost_overrides.py`). This is what `UserUsageTracingProcessor`
  writes on every priced generation span.
- **Tenant usage limiting** (`db/usage.py`, `TenantUsage`): a cloud-only
  rolling-window counter (LLM cost, chunks indexed, API calls) checked against
  a hard limit via `db/usage.py:check_usage_limit`, independent of the
  per-user ledger. See `[[rate-and-usage-limits]]`.

The EE usage-report pipeline
(`ee/onyx/background/celery/tasks/usage_reporting/tasks.py:generate_usage_report_task`)
runs as a Celery task and calls
`ee/onyx/server/reporting/usage_export_generation.py:create_new_usage_report`,
which builds the CSV+PDF ZIP described in `docs/usage/usage-reports.md`.

### 4.10 Hooks

A hook is a customer-owned HTTPS endpoint Onyx calls synchronously at one of
three fixed points (`db/enums.py:HookPoint`: `DOCUMENT_INGESTION`,
`DOCUMENT_PUSH`, `QUERY_PROCESSING`), each described by a `HookPointSpec`
registered in `hooks/registry.py:_REGISTRY`. The CE entry point,
`hooks/executor.py:execute_hook`, dispatches through
`fetch_versioned_implementation` to a CE no-op (`HookSkipped`) or, on EE, to
`ee/onyx/hooks/executor.py:_execute_hook_impl`, which looks up the active hook,
posts the payload via `utils/external_endpoint.py:post_json_to_endpoint`, and
applies the hook's `fail_strategy` (`HARD` raises `OnyxError`, aborting the
pipeline; `SOFT` logs and returns `HookSoftFailed`, letting the caller fall
back to default behavior). Execution is logged only on failure
(`db/hook.py:create_hook_execution_log__no_commit`); `is_reachable` is updated
best-effort in its own session so a concurrent hook deletion cannot block the
failure log write. At most one non-deleted hook exists per `HookPoint`.
Hooks are unavailable under `MULTI_TENANT` (`ee/onyx/hooks/executor.py:_lookup_hook`).
The Community downgrade soft-deletes every hook (`deleted=True`, `is_active=False`)
in `ee/onyx/db/community_downgrade.py:disable_paid_features__no_commit` (see [[billing]] §4.5).
`QUERY_PROCESSING` fires only for chat queries submitted through the Onyx
app; it never fires for `/gateway/*` requests, so a hook cannot inspect or
reject content an external tool sends to a model provider through
[[llm-gateway]] (`hooks/points/query_processing.py`).

---

## 5. Contracts and invariants

1. **Every new LLM, embedding, rerank, image-generation, or voice call site
   needs an explicit `LLMFlow` tag** via `llm_generation_span` or
   `traced_llm_call`. `UNTAGGED_INVOKE` / `UNTAGGED_STREAM` in a dashboard
   means missing instrumentation at that call site, not a tracing bug.
2. **Masking must run before content leaves the process.** Any new external
   trace destination needs its own `mask_sensitive_data` wiring; adding a
   provider without it is a silent data-exposure regression (see §9).
3. **Incognito content must never reach an external trace backend.** Both
   `braintrust_tracing_processor.py` and `langfuse_tracing_processor.py` check
   `suppresses_external_traces()` before emitting; a new tracing processor
   must add the same check.
4. **`/metrics` must stay authenticated by default.** `metrics_auth.py:verify_metrics_token`
   fails closed: if neither `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN` nor `DISABLE_METRICS_AUTH` is
   set, every request gets 401. Do not weaken this default.
5. **A new HTTP-scoped or connector-scoped metric needs a `tenant_id` label
   (or an explicit single-tenant-only decision) in a multi-tenant
   deployment**, or it silently aggregates across every customer on the
   shared cluster.
6. **Tracing admin config is unavailable under `MULTI_TENANT`.**
   `_reject_if_multi_tenant` blocks every `/admin/tracing/*` route; cloud
   configuration is env-var only.
7. **Metric label cardinality stays bounded.** Never label with a raw
   user/document ID or a free-form connector name on a per-task counter
   (`docs/METRICS.md` "Cardinality warning"); use IDs/enums, or move the field
   to a pull-based collector where cardinality is naturally bounded.
8. **The audit `action` taxonomy is append-only.** Consumers filter on
   specific `action` strings; renaming or removing one breaks every existing
   SIEM rule (`docs/AUDIT_LOGGING.md`).
9. **At most one non-deleted hook exists per `HookPoint`**, enforced by
   `db/hook.py:create_hook__no_commit` and a DB partial unique index.
10. **A `HookFailStrategy.HARD` hook failure must abort the calling
    pipeline; `SOFT` must fall back to default behavior**, never silently
    succeed with no data.

---

## 6. Relationships

**Depends on**
- [[llm-providers]]: `LitellmLLM.invoke`/`stream` (`multi_llm.py`), which open
  the generation span and fall back to the untagged flows, and the cost computation
  (`llm/cost.py:compute_cost_cents`) that usage accounting calls.
- [[multi-tenancy]]: `MULTI_TENANT` gates tracing admin config, per-tenant
  metric labelling, and connector-state metric collection.
- [[editions-and-gating]]: hooks, usage export/reporting, log export, and
  query history are EE-only.
- [[chat-persistence]]: incognito's persistence contract (`persist_content`)
  is the sibling of the incognito tracing suppression described here.
- [[background-jobs]]: the usage-report Celery task, the log-export Celery
  collector, and per-worker Celery signal handlers that emit task metrics.
- [[rate-and-usage-limits]]: `TenantUsage` and `db/usage.py:check_usage_limit`
  are the cloud usage-limit ledger this component also touches.

**Depended on by**
- [[core-chat-loop]]: every chat turn opens tagged generation spans and
  produces usage records through this component.
- [[indexing-pipeline]]: contextual RAG summarization and connector-state
  metrics are emitted from here.
- [[llm-providers]]: cost tracking and the tracing admin endpoints live in
  this component even though `llm-providers.md` documents the LLM-side
  factory that calls into them.

## 7. Blast radius

| If your change... | Also check |
|---|---|
| adds an LLM call site | Tag it with an `LLMFlow` (add the enum value first); verify no new `UNTAGGED_*` span appears (§8) |
| adds a Prometheus metric | `docs/METRICS.md` reference tables; label cardinality; a `tenant_id` label if the metric is HTTP- or connector-scoped and multi-tenant applies; a unit test under `backend/tests/unit/server/metrics/` or `backend/tests/unit/onyx/server/metrics/` |
| changes masking (`tracing/masking.py`) | Both Braintrust and Langfuse paths; confirm the redaction still fires before `braintrust.set_masking_function` / any equivalent Langfuse hook is added |
| changes a trace processor (`braintrust_tracing_processor.py`, `langfuse_tracing_processor.py`, or a new one) | The incognito check (`suppresses_external_traces`) must still gate it; `dynamic_processor.py`'s delegate rebuild and drain-on-retire logic |
| adds a usage-recorded action (a new `LLMFlow`, a new system attribution) | `tracing/flows.py:SYSTEM_TEXT_GENERATION_FLOWS` if it should count as system usage; `processors/user_usage_processor.py:_system_attribution`; the usage export/report pipeline that reads `UserUsage` |
| adds a new `HookPoint` | `hooks/registry.py:_REGISTRY` (validated at startup by `validate_registry`); a new `HookPointSpec`; the EE UI's hook-point catalogue |
| changes the audit action taxonomy | `docs/AUDIT_LOGGING.md`; every downstream SIEM filter rule depends on the exact string |

---

## 8. How to verify a change

### Confirming a new call site is tagged

1. Connect Braintrust or Langfuse (`PUT`/`POST /admin/tracing/providers`, or
   set `BRAINTRUST_*`/`LANGFUSE_*` env vars) and confirm it shows in
   `GET /admin/tracing/providers`.
2. Exercise the new call site.
3. In the tracing dashboard, confirm the span's `model_config.flow` is the new
   `LLMFlow` value, not `untagged_invoke` / `untagged_stream`.

### Scraping `/metrics` locally

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

Without a token configured, expect a 401 unless `DISABLE_METRICS_AUTH=true` is
set. Celery worker metrics have no auth; scrape the worker's own port
(e.g. `curl http://localhost:9093/metrics` for docprocessing).

### Tests

```bash
# Metrics
cd backend && uv run pytest -xv tests/unit/server/metrics tests/unit/onyx/server/metrics
cd backend && uv run pytest -xv tests/external_dependency_unit/db/test_index_attempt_stage_metrics.py

# Tracing
cd backend && uv run pytest -xv tests/unit/onyx/tracing tests/unit/onyx/llm/test_client_tracing.py
uv run --env-file .vscode/.env pytest -xv backend/tests/external_dependency_unit/tracing

# Hooks
cd backend && uv run pytest -k hook tests/unit tests/external_dependency_unit
```

Notable existing tests: `tests/unit/onyx/tracing/test_flows_registry.py`,
`test_dynamic_processor.py`, `test_braintrust_incognito_suppression.py`,
`test_langfuse_incognito_suppression.py`, `test_metadata_only_tracing.py`,
`test_user_usage_processor.py`, and
`tests/external_dependency_unit/tracing/test_tracing_admin_api.py`,
`test_tracing_provider_config.py`, `test_llm_span_recording.py`.

See `backend/AGENTS.md` for authoritative commands and required env.

### What "working" looks like

- No unexpected `UNTAGGED_INVOKE`/`UNTAGGED_STREAM` spans from the code path
  you touched.
- `/metrics` returns 401 with no token, and the expected series with a valid
  one.
- A trace produced under incognito never appears in Braintrust/Langfuse, but
  its tokens still land in `UserUsage` with `incognito=true`.
- A `HARD` hook failure aborts the pipeline; a `SOFT` failure logs and the
  pipeline continues with default behavior.

## 9. Footguns

- **`UNTAGGED_INVOKE` / `UNTAGGED_STREAM` in a dashboard means missing
  instrumentation**, not a tracing bug. Add an explicit
  `llm_generation_span`/`traced_llm_call` at the call site.
- **`/metrics` is locked by default.** If neither `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN` nor
  `DISABLE_METRICS_AUTH=true` is set, every scrape gets 401. This surprises
  people setting up a fresh deployment; it is intentional
  (`metrics_auth.py`: "fail secure").
- **Cloud (`MULTI_TENANT`) is env-only for tracing.** The tracing admin
  endpoints are rejected outright, and `resolve_effective_tracing_config`
  never reads the DB, so there is no way to configure Braintrust/Langfuse
  per-tenant on cloud today.
- **Masking is Braintrust-specific today.** `mask_sensitive_data` is wired
  through `braintrust.set_masking_function`; `langfuse_tracing_processor.py`
  has no equivalent call, so a Langfuse-only deployment does not get the same
  redaction pass before data leaves the process.
- **Incognito suppression and incognito usage accounting are different
  guarantees.** External traces are dropped entirely for an incognito turn;
  its token/cost usage is still recorded in `UserUsage`, just labeled
  `incognito=true`. Do not assume "incognito" means "invisible everywhere."
- **Audit logging has no DB table or read API yet.** The only supported
  consumption path is an external log shipper on the `onyx.audit` logger
  prefix (`docs/AUDIT_LOGGING.md` "Roadmap").
- **`UserUsage` and `TenantUsage` are unrelated tables that both mean
  "usage."** `UserUsage` is per-actor LLM cost/token accounting;
  `TenantUsage` is the cloud usage-limit ledger checked by
  `db/usage.py:check_usage_limit`. Writing to one does not affect the other.
- **A hook's `is_reachable` update and its failure log are written in
  separate sessions on purpose**, so a concurrent hook deletion (which makes
  the `is_reachable` write raise `NOT_FOUND`) cannot suppress the failure log.
