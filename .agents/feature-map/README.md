# Onyx Feature Map

A map of what Onyx **is**: every product surface, what it does, the code that
implements it, and how the pieces connect.

It exists for one job: let an agent that starts with **no context** verify that a
change is correct and complete. Not "does it compile", but "does it do the right
thing, and what else did it just break".

## How to use this map

### To verify a pull request

The full procedure is [VERIFYING.md](VERIFYING.md). In short:

1. Get the changed paths: `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD`
2. Look each path up in [PATHS.md](PATHS.md). That gives you the components you touched.
3. Read each component doc. Sections 1 and 4 tell you what the code is *supposed* to do.
4. Check the diff against **§5 Contracts and invariants**. These are the rules a
   change can break silently.
5. Walk **§7 Blast radius**. It lists what else to check for your kind of change.
6. Run **§8 How to verify**. Tests plus a manual reproduction.
7. Repeat for every component listed under "Depends on" that your change reaches into.

### To understand a feature before building on it

Start at [INDEX.md](INDEX.md), find the domain, read the component doc.
Follow `[[links]]` to neighbours.

### Vocabulary

Onyx overloads several words (persona/agent, chunk/section, cc-pair). Read
[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) before you trust your intuition about a name.

## Files

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [VERIFYING.md](VERIFYING.md) | The step-by-step procedure for checking a PR with this map. |
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | The sitemap. Every component, grouped by domain. |
| [PATHS.md](PATHS.md) | Reverse lookup: code path → component. Start here for a diff. |
| [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) | Domain vocabulary and the words Onyx overloads. |
| [components/](components/) | One document per component. |

## The component document schema

Every file in `components/` has the same header (§0) and nine numbered sections
(`## 1.` to `## 9.`), in the same order, so an agent can jump straight to the section
it needs.

| § | Section | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Header | Domain, edition (CE/EE), owned code paths |
| 1 | What the user experiences | Product behaviour, no code |
| 2 | Surfaces | Routes, endpoints, tasks, env vars |
| 3 | Data model | Tables and columns |
| 4 | How it works | The flow, each step naming `file:function` |
| 5 | Contracts and invariants | Rules a change can break silently |
| 6 | Relationships | Depends on / depended on by |
| 7 | Blast radius | Change type → what else to check |
| 8 | How to verify a change | Tests, commands, manual reproduction |
| 9 | Footguns | Traps and non-obvious behaviour |

## Rules for writing and updating

- **Every technical claim carries a `path:symbol` reference.** A claim with no
  reference is a guess, and a guess in this map is worse than a gap.
- **Write what is true now**, not what is planned. No changelogs, no history.
- **Do not duplicate the code.** Describe intent, contracts, and connections.
  Line-by-line restatement goes stale in a week.
- **Prefer symbol references over line numbers.** `chat/llm_loop.py:run_llm_loop`
  survives edits; `llm_loop.py:412` does not.
- **If you change a component, update its doc in the same PR.** A stale map is a
  liability.
- **Every component records the commit it was last checked against**, on its
  `**Verified against:** \`<sha>\` (<date>)` line. When you re-check a whole
  document against the code, set the line to the commit you checked and today's
  date. A small doc fix in a code PR does not change it. To find the components
  that may be stale, list the commits since that hash on the component's code
  paths: `git log <sha>..HEAD -- <paths from PATHS.md>`.
- Prose follows the ASD-STE100 rules in the root `AGENTS.md`: short sentences,
  active voice, one word for one idea.
