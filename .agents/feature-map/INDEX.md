# Onyx Component Index

The sitemap. Every product surface in Onyx, grouped by domain.

`✅` document written

Onyx is two products sharing one platform:

- **Chat + Search.** Ask a question, the system retrieves from your connected
  company data and answers with citations.
- **Craft.** An agentic coding product that runs a coding agent in a sandbox.

Both sit on shared platform services: auth, tenancy, LLM access, background jobs.

The chat turn. A user sends a message; the system assembles context, runs an LLM
loop with tools, streams packets back, and saves the turn.

## Incomplete features

These have code in the tree but do not work end to end yet. They are planned to
return. Do not assume any part of them works, and keep the existing code in place
when you clean up nearby code.

| Feature | State |
|---|---|
| Knowledge graph | Incomplete. What exists: the `kg_*` tables, the `document.kg_stage` and `connector.kg_processing_enabled` columns, the config in the `kg_config` key-value row (`db/kg_config.py`), default entity types (`onyx/kg/setup/`), and the mounted admin API at `/admin/kg` (`server/kg/api.py`: `/exposed`, `/reset`, `/config`, `/entity-types`). Enabling it creates a "KG Beta" persona. What does not work: there is no extraction pipeline (no Celery task fills the tables), no admin page in `web/src`, and `KnowledgeGraphTool` cannot run. It is in `BUILT_IN_TOOL_MAP`, but `run` raises `NotImplementedError` and its branch in `tool_constructor.py:_construct_tools_impl` is commented out, so a persona that has it gets no KG tool. See [[tools-framework]] §9. |

## Admin panel coverage

`web/src/lib/admin-routes.ts` is the authoritative list of admin routes. Every one
of its 41 entries maps to a written component, across 22 components.

To re-check after changing the admin panel, list the routes and confirm each still
has an owner here:

```bash
grep -oE 'path: "/admin[^"]*"' web/src/lib/admin-routes.ts | sort -u
```

Two traps when auditing this yourself:

- Some `/admin/*` paths are served from a second tree, `web/src/app/ee/admin/`, via a
  rewrite in `web/src/proxy.ts:EE_ROUTES`. Listing `web/src/app/admin/` alone misses
  theme, standard-answer, export-logs, performance, and groups.
- A directory under `ee/admin/` that is **not** in `EE_ROUTES` is unreachable.
  The billing page is `web/src/app/admin/billing/`.

## Unmapped code

Anything not listed above is unmapped. If you touch unmapped code, say so in the
PR rather than assuming it is low risk, and add the component here.
