"""migrate_no_auth_data_to_placeholder

This migration handles the transition from AUTH_TYPE=disabled to requiring
authentication. It creates a placeholder user and assigns all data that was
created without a user (user_id=NULL) to this placeholder.

A database trigger is installed that automatically transfers all data from
the placeholder user to the first real user who registers, then drops itself.
