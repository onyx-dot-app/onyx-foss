"""Choosing which identity to impersonate for a shared drive, and telling an
unreachable drive apart from an empty one.

A shared drive organizer (Manager in the UI) can always open folders with
limited access inside that drive, and that access cannot be revoked. So one
organizer pass returns everything, where a union over arbitrary members can
silently miss restricted folders. Probes against the onyx-test tenant measured
the gap: the organizer saw 25 items in shared_drive_1, a reader saw 23.

Nothing here calls the retrieval path; it only decides who should do the call.
