"""Per-source planning rules for connector config edits.

The default rules classify an edit field by field from the field policies
(see ``field_policy`` and ``config_diff``). A planning rule handles the cases
those policies cannot express, e.g. mode fields that change the meaning of
other fields. A rule is a plain function of the validated old and new config.
It returns None to use the default rules for every field, so it handles only
the special cases. ``planning_rule_registry`` maps each source to its rule.

This module must stay light to import: connector config modules import it.
