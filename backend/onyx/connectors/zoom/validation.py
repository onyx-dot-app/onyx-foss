"""Live checks that run before a crawl starts, with an admin waiting on the
result the first time.

`validate_connector_settings` runs on every indexing attempt, and anything
raised from here other than UnexpectedValidationError pauses the connector, so
these probe only what should stop a crawl: the credentials, the scopes and the
add-ons. Whether one id or email is right is discovery's job, and it reports
every bad one as an indexing error.
