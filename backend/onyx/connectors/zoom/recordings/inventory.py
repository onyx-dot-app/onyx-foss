"""Every Zoom document that still exists, for pruning and the permission doc
sync: one whose recording its host's listing still shows, however old, which
leaves deleted and trashed recordings out. Anything left out here is deleted by
pruning and made private by the doc sync, so unlike discovery this raises rather
than skips, and it walks from Zoom's launch rather than the poll window. The one
skip is a host Zoom says it has no record of, whose documents are meant to go.
The caller renews its lock only when it receives a batch, so batches go out
even when they are empty.
