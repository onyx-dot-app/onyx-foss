"""Every Zoom document that still exists, for pruning.

A document still exists if its recording still appears in its host's recordings
listing, which leaves deleted and trashed recordings out and has no age limit.

This is the mirror image of discovery.py. Discovery skips what it cannot read
and reports a failure, but anything skipped here is deleted instead, so this
raises rather than skipping, and it walks from Zoom's launch rather than the
poll window. The one thing it does skip is a host Zoom says it has no record
of, whose documents are then meant to go. The caller renews its lock only when
it receives a batch, so batches go out even when they are empty.
