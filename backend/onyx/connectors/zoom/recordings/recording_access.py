"""Who may read a transcript: whoever Zoom lets watch its cloud recording.

The owner always may; beyond that the recording's Link access decides, read
from its share settings and, for a domain rule, the account's sign-in rule
catalogue. Nothing here touches a meeting or webinar endpoint: who attended or
was invited is not who may watch. Zoom cannot say who is in "People with
access", so that share, like any the connector does not recognise, grants
nobody but the owner. An owner's address and the account's rule catalogue are
the same for every recording in a run, so the caller memoises both, and the
catalogue is only asked for when a recording names a rule.
