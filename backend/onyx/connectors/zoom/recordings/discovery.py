"""How an occurrence gets into indexing scope. An admin turns on any mix of an
ID allowlist, a host-email allowlist, and a Zoom Group, and whatever is
configured gets unioned together.

Sources hand back occurrences rather than session IDs because the mechanisms
find them differently: the ID allowlist expands each configured ID, while
host and Group discovery read per-user recording listings that already name
each occurrence. A duplicate arriving from two sources is left alone, since
documents are keyed by occurrence UUID and get upserted.
