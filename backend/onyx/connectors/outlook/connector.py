"""Outlook connector: Microsoft 365 mail and calendar over Graph.

One document per mail thread by the header rules in ``threads.py``, and with
calendars on, one per event or recurring series per mailbox. Every Graph call
goes through ``OutlookSourceOperations``.

Each mailbox is walked on its own, a few side by side. Its folders are read
through delta pages of message metadata, headers included, one page per
checkpoint step, and the rows are held in memory until the last folder is
done. Each conversation is then decided from that copy alone and the bodies
of the messages its documents need are read.

Incremental runs come from the poll window rather than saved delta links: an
index attempt starts from a fresh checkpoint, so each folder's delta round
opens with ``receivedDateTime ge start`` and any conversation that gained a
message in the window is read whole through its outline and rebuilt.

Pruning walks the same mailboxes, folders and calendar windows but reads only
metadata, so a thread deleted from every mailbox leaves the index without a
full re-index. A thread that lost one message keeps the stale text until it
gains a message or a full re-index rebuilds it.
