"""Celery tasks for the granular capability check runs.

The run task is enqueued by ``start_capability_check_run`` (the manual trigger
endpoint, cc-pair creation and credential swap) after it marks the scope's row
RUNNING, and writes through the unconditional upsert: a granular
run is the freshest truth and replaces whatever is stored (see the accessors'
writer model). A run that fails gracefully records FAILED_TO_RUN itself; only
hard kills and expired tasks leave their row RUNNING for the beat sweep to
retire once the mark outlives its source's run ceiling.
