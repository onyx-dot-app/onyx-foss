"""Phased service account retrieval against an in-memory tenant.

The tenant covers the cases the redesign exists for: a limited-access folder
only a drive organizer sees, an organizer reached through a group, a drive with
no organizer, a drive nobody can list, shortcuts into covered scopes, a file
shared with several users, and a user whose impersonation fails.
