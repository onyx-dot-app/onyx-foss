"""Dedup-set behavior for Google Drive retrieval.

The set exists only to avoid re-downloading a file within one run, so it is
bounded: past the cap the connector re-yields and lets the indexing pipeline
drop the duplicate. It must never grow without limit, because the checkpoint is
re-serialized on every connector yield.
