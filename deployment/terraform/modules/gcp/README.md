# Onyx GCP modules

## Status

These modules pass validation against the `google` provider schema. Each one
has a `terraform test` suite that plans it against a mocked provider. No one
has applied them to a live project yet. Treat the first deployment as a first
deployment.

## Overview

This directory contains Terraform modules to provision the core GCP
infrastructure for Onyx:

- `vpc`: a custom-mode VPC with one subnet, secondary ranges for pods and
  services, Cloud NAT for egress, flow logs, and Private Service Access for
  Cloud SQL and Memorystore
- `gke`: a regional GKE Standard cluster with Workload Identity, private
  nodes, pools for the application and the document index, optional GPU and
  sandbox pools, and the Onyx namespace and service account
- `postgres`: a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance with a private IP only, and
  five alert policies
- `redis`: a Memorystore for Redis instance with AUTH on, and five alert
  policies
- `gcs`: a bucket for the Onyx file store, with versioning, lifecycle rules
  and public access prevention
- `cloud-armor`: a Cloud Armor policy with the OWASP Core Rule Set, two rate
  limits, and optional IP and country rules
- `onyx`: a higher-level composition that wires the above together

Use the `onyx` module for a working cluster with sane defaults. Use the
individual modules when you need more control.

These mirror the AWS modules in `../aws` and the Azure modules in `../azure`.
Read [Differences from the AWS and Azure
modules](#differences-from-the-aws-and-azure-modules) before you port a
configuration across.

## Consuming these modules from another repository

The quickstart below uses local paths. To consume the modules from a different
repository, point `source` at this repository and pin a ref:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx.git//deployment/terraform/modules/gcp/vpc?ref=tf-gcp/v1.0.0"
  project_id = "my-project"
  region     = "us-east1"
}
```

GCP releases have tags of the form `tf-gcp/vX.Y.Z`. Their versions are
independent of the AWS modules (`tf/`), the Azure modules (`tf-azure/`) and
Onyx product releases. A commit sha also works as a `ref`. Automated consumers
should use a sha: no one can move a sha, but someone can move a tag.

Pin something. Without a `ref`, Terraform tracks the default branch, and an
unrelated merge can change your infrastructure.

## Quickstart (copy/paste)

This module declares no `provider` block. Your root module configures the
`google` provider and the `kubernetes` provider.

```hcl
locals {
  project_id = "my-project"
  region     = "us-east1"
  # Supply this from a secret store or TF_VAR_ in anything but a scratch stack.
  postgres_password = "your-postgres-password"
}

provider "google" {
  project = local.project_id
  region  = local.region
}

module "onyx" {
  source = "./modules/gcp/onyx"

  name       = "onyx"
  project_id = local.project_id
  region     = local.region
  size       = "medium"

  postgres_password = local.postgres_password

  # Required. A public API server with no authorized networks is open to every
  # address on the internet. The module refuses to build one unless you
  # restrict it, make it private, or say the exposure is intended.
  master_authorized_networks = [
    { cidr_block = "203.0.113.0/24", display_name = "office" },
  ]
}

# An access token for whoever runs Terraform. It is not keyed on the cluster,
# so Terraform can read it at plan time, before the cluster exists.
data "google_client_config" "default" {}

# The composition creates a namespace and a service account, so the kubernetes
# provider needs the cluster. It reads the address and CA from the module.
provider "kubernetes" {
  host                   = module.onyx.cluster_endpoint
  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.onyx.cluster_ca_certificate)
  token                  = data.google_client_config.default.access_token
}

output "gcs_bucket_name" {
  value = module.onyx.gcs_bucket_name
}

output "postgres_host" {
  value = module.onyx.postgres_host
}

output "redis_host" {
  value = module.onyx.redis_host
}
```

Then:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Configure the `kubernetes` provider from the module outputs, as above. Do not
use a `data "google_container_cluster"` keyed on the cluster name: on the first
apply the cluster does not exist, and the read fails at plan. Do not add
`depends_on` to that data source or to the module either. It defers reads to
apply time, and plan values that must be known become unknown. Module outputs
carry the dependency without either problem. The Azure modules use the same
pattern for the same reason.

## T-shirt sizing

`size` sets every compute and data-plane knob together. Any individual sizing
variable set to a non-null value overrides its tier default.

| | small | medium | large |
|---|---|---|---|
| main pool machine | `n2-standard-8` | `n2-standard-16` | `n2-standard-16` |
| main pool nodes | 1-3 | 1-5 | 2-8 |
| index pool machine | `n2-highmem-4` | `n2-highmem-8` | `n2-highmem-16` |
| index pool disk | 256 GB | 512 GB | 1024 GB |
| database tier | `db-custom-2-8192` | `db-custom-2-8192` | `db-custom-4-16384` |
| database disk | 64 GB | 128 GB | 256 GB |
| cache | 5 GB | 10 GB | 20 GB |

Roughly: small suits pilots and small teams, medium a department or company,
large an org-wide deployment. Node counts are for the whole pool, not per zone.
The index pool is memory-optimised at every tier because on GCP it carries the
document index itself.

### Using an existing network

```hcl
module "onyx" {
  source = "./modules/gcp/onyx"

  project_id     = "my-project"
  region         = "us-east1"
  create_network = false

  network_id          = "projects/my-project/global/networks/shared"
  subnet_id           = "projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/subnetworks/gke"
  pods_range_name     = "gke-pods"
  services_range_name = "gke-services"

  postgres_password          = local.postgres_password
  master_authorized_networks = [{ cidr_block = "203.0.113.0/24" }]
}
```

The network must already have a Private Service Access connection, or Cloud
SQL and Memorystore fail to create. The nodes have no public IPs, so the
subnet also needs a Cloud NAT for egress. `enable_flow_logs` does nothing here;
configure flow logs on your own subnet.

## What each module does

### `onyx`

Enables the project APIs, then wires the modules below together with t-shirt
sizing. Its outputs carry everything the Helm chart needs. One
`deletion_protection` switch guards the cluster, database, cache, bucket and
Cloud Armor policy.

### `vpc`

A custom-mode network and one subnet. The subnet has secondary ranges for pods
and services, and Private Google Access, so nodes reach Google APIs without the
NAT. Cloud NAT gives private nodes egress. The module reserves a Private
Service Access range and peers it. Its `private_service_access_network_id`
output arrives only once the peering exists, so Cloud SQL and Memorystore wait
for it.

### `gke`

A regional GKE Standard cluster with Dataplane V2, private nodes, Workload
Identity and the Gateway API. The nodes run as a dedicated service account with
the minimum roles. It creates a main pool, a tainted document-index pool, and
optional GPU and Craft sandbox pools. It also creates the `onyx` namespace and
the `onyx-workload-access` service account.

### `postgres`

A Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance with a private IP only, TLS enforced,
backups and point-in-time recovery. It creates the `onyx` database. It sets the
password of the `postgres` user that Cloud SQL ships.

### `redis`

A Memorystore for Redis instance on the Private Service Access range. AUTH is
always on. The eviction policy is `volatile-lru`, because Celery broker keys
carry no TTL and an `allkeys-*` policy would drop queued tasks. RDB snapshots
are on.

### `gcs`

A bucket with uniform access, public access prevention, versioning, and a
lifecycle rule for old versions. It grants the workload identity principal
object access and the narrow read that Onyx needs at startup.

### `cloud-armor`

A backend security policy with the OWASP Core Rule Set at sensitivity 1, an API
rate limit, a global rate limit and Adaptive Protection. It takes effect only on
an L7 load balancer; see below.

## Differences from the AWS and Azure modules

Most of these follow from the platform rather than from taste.

| | AWS | Azure | GCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| document index | managed OpenSearch, or in-cluster | in-cluster only | in-cluster only; GCP has no managed OpenSearch |
| cache | ElastiCache | Azure Managed Redis, off by default | Memorystore for Redis, on by default |
| pod identity | IRSA: assume a role | federate a managed identity to a service account | grant IAM roles straight to the Kubernetes service account |
| WAF attachment | ALB | Application Gateway | L7 load balancer through a BackendConfig or GCPBackendPolicy |
| flow logs | on, to CloudWatch | opt-in, needs a storage account | on, to Cloud Logging |
| project APIs | none | none | enabled by the composition |
| provider config | declared inside the composition | declared by your root module | declared by your root module |

**Managed Redis works here with no extra settings.** Onyx uses database 0 for
the app, 14 for Celery results and 15 for the Celery broker. Memorystore for
Redis is one primary endpoint with the default 16 databases. The Onyx defaults
work unchanged. Azure Managed Redis has only database 0, and the Redis Cluster
products shard keys, which breaks Celery with `CROSSSLOT`. So the composition
turns Memorystore on by default. Set `enable_redis = false` to use the
in-cluster Redis.

**The document index runs in the cluster.** GCP has no managed OpenSearch. The
chart's OpenSearch subchart runs on the tainted index pool.

**Workload Identity needs no Google service account.** GKE Workload Identity
Federation lets IAM name a Kubernetes service account directly. The bucket
grant goes to the `workload_identity_principal` output. There is no Google
service account to impersonate and no annotation on the Kubernetes service
account. Use the same output to grant access to other resources.

**Cloud Armor attaches only to an L7 load balancer.** Put the
`cloud_armor_policy_name` output in a GKE `BackendConfig`
(`spec.securityPolicy.name`) for Ingress, or in a `GCPBackendPolicy`
(`spec.default.securityPolicy`) for Gateway. The chart's ingress-nginx
controller sits behind a Service of type `LoadBalancer`, which is an L4
passthrough load balancer. That load balancer cannot carry the policy. The
policy then protects nothing, and nothing reports it. This is the same trap as
the Azure WAF policy without an Application Gateway.

**Flow logs are on by default.** GCP writes them to Cloud Logging and needs no
extra infrastructure. Azure needs a Network Watcher and a storage account, so
it keeps them off.

**The composition enables the project APIs.** A new project has most of them
off. `enable_project_apis` turns on Compute, GKE, Cloud SQL Admin, Memorystore,
Service Networking, Storage, Monitoring, Logging, IAM and Resource Manager. It
never turns them off on destroy, because other workloads may use them.

## Installing the Onyx Helm chart (after Terraform)

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$(terraform output -raw cluster_name)" \
  --location "$(terraform output -raw location)" --project my-project
```

**Install into the `onyx` namespace.** A Kubernetes service account belongs to
one namespace, and the `gke` module creates the one with the bucket grant in
`onyx`. A release in a different namespace references an account that does not
exist there, and the API and Celery pods never start.

Terraform creates the namespace itself, because the service account needs it
and the Helm install happens afterwards. So the release joins that namespace
and does not create one:

```bash
helm install onyx onyx/onyx --namespace onyx -f values.yaml
```

Set `create_workload_namespace = false` if something else already creates it.

Four pieces of chart configuration are necessary. Their defaults do not work
here, so a plain `helm install` does not use the infrastructure that Terraform
built.

### 1. Point the workloads at the workload service account

The chart runs every Onyx pod, including the API server and the Celery
workers, as `serviceAccount.name`. The bucket grant names that account, so no
pod label and no annotation are necessary. Without it, the pods run as
`default` and every file store call gets `403`.

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: false
  name: onyx-workload-access   # the gke module's default, in namespace onyx
```

### 2. Point the file store at the bucket

Turn off the bundled MinIO and set the GCS keys. The chart copies every
non-empty `configMap` key into the pod environment, so no chart change is
necessary.

```yaml
minio:
  enabled: false

configMap:
  FILE_STORE_BACKEND: "gcs"
  GCS_FILE_STORE_BUCKET_NAME: "<gcs_bucket_name output>"
  GCS_PROJECT_ID: "<gcs_project_id output>"
```

Leave `GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` and `GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON` unset.
Onyx then uses Application Default Credentials, which pick up the workload
identity from step 1.

### 3. Point Onyx at Cloud SQL and Memorystore

```yaml
postgresql:
  enabled: false

redis:
  enabled: false

configMap:
  POSTGRES_HOST: "<postgres_host output>"
  POSTGRES_PORT: "5432"
  POSTGRES_DB: "onyx"            # postgres_db_name output
  REDIS_HOST: "<redis_host output>"
  REDIS_PORT: "6379"             # redis_port output

auth:
  postgresql:
    existingSecret: "onyx-postgresql"   # keys: username, password
  redis:
    existingSecret: "onyx-redis"        # key: redis_password = redis_auth_string output
```

Set `POSTGRES_DB`. Without it, Onyx uses the `postgres` database that Cloud SQL
ships, and the `onyx` database stays empty.

Create the two secrets in the `onyx` namespace from the Terraform outputs.
Do not put the passwords in `values.yaml`. Cloud SQL accepts only encrypted
connections, and Onyx encrypts by default, so no TLS setting is necessary. With
`redis_transit_encryption_enabled = true`, also set `REDIS_PORT: "6378"` and
the chart's `redisTls` values, with the CA from the redis module's
`server_ca_certs` output.

### 4. Send the document index to its own node pool

The `gke` module taints the index pool `document-index=true:NoSchedule`, so
nothing else lands on it. The OpenSearch subchart sets no tolerations of its
own. Without this, it goes onto the main pool and the index pool stays empty:

```yaml
opensearch:
  nodeSelector:
    onyx.app/workload: document-index
  tolerations:
    - key: document-index
      operator: Equal
      value: "true"
      effect: NoSchedule
```

Set `index_node_pool_enabled = false` to run the index on the main pool and
skip this.

## Testing

Every module has a `terraform test` suite that plans it against a mocked
provider. The suites need no GCP project and no credentials:

```bash
cd deployment/terraform/modules/gcp/vpc
terraform init -backend=false
terraform test
```

They cover the wiring and the input validation. Without them, a wrong argument
name or an out-of-range value shows only at apply. They do not prove that the
modules work against GCP. Only an apply does that.

## Security

- The bucket has uniform access and enforced public access prevention, so no
  object can become public.
- The database and cache have private IPs only. The database refuses
  unencrypted connections. The cache always requires AUTH.
- Nodes have no public IPs, run as a dedicated service account with the
  minimum roles, and use shielded VMs. Pods see only their own identity through
  the GKE metadata server.
- The API server will not be built open. Set `master_authorized_networks`, or
  `private_endpoint_enabled`, or `allow_unrestricted_api_server_access` to
  record that an open control plane is what you meant.
- The database will not be built without a password of at least 8 characters.
- `deletion_protection` is on by default for the cluster, database, cache,
  bucket and Cloud Armor policy. Set it to `false` and apply before a destroy.
