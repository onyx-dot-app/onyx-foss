# Log

**Import:** `import { Log } from "@opal/components";`

One line of a log or report: an icon, a title, centre content and trailing
content.
A list of checks, the steps of a job, or the entries of an audit trail are each
a column of `Log`s. A line is not interactive.

## Props

| Prop             | Type                    | Default     | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `variant`        | `LogVariant`            | `"default"` | Status and weight: colours the icon; heavy also tints the line               |
| `icon`           | `IconFunctionComponent` | —           | Shown at 1rem with 0.125rem padding                                          |
| `title`          | `string \| RichStr`     | —           | `secondary-action` in `text-03`, one line, in a 10rem column                 |
| `centerChildren` | `ReactNode`             | —           | Fills the rest of the row from its start; the caller sets its colour and fit |
| `rightChildren`  | `ReactNode`             | —           | Trailing content, such as a tag or an action; not padded                     |

## Variants

`LogVariant` is `"default"` or a status and a weight, e.g. `"error-heavy"`. The
statuses are a subset of `StatusVariants`:
`LogStatus = Extract<StatusVariants, "default" | "success" | "warning" | "error">`.

| Status    | Icon                | `heavy` background  |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `default` | `text-03`           | — (never heavy)     |
| `success` | `status-success-05` | `status-success-01` |
| `warning` | `theme-amber-05`    | `theme-amber-01`    |
| `error`   | `status-error-05`   | `status-error-01`   |

A `light` line has no background. Use `heavy` for the lines that need action,
such as a failure that blocks. The variant sets colours only; pass the icon
that fits the state (for example a spinner, a clock or an hourglass). The
title is always `text-03`; `centerChildren` brings its own colour, so a caller
can match it to the variant.

## Layout

- A row `Section`, 2.25rem tall with 0.5rem padding and a 0.25rem gap, so tall
  trailing content cannot stretch the line. The title column is exactly 10rem,
  and 1rem separates it from the centre content, and the centre content from
  the trailing content.
- A title too long for its column is cut with an ellipsis and shows in full
  in a tooltip. `centerChildren` handles its own overflow.

## Usage

```tsx
<Log
  variant="error-heavy"
  icon={SvgXCircle}
  title="Check attachment access"
  centerChildren={
    <Text font="main-ui-body" color="status-error-05" maxLines={1}>
      Attachment download timed out
    </Text>
  }
  rightChildren={<Tag title="Required" color="gray" />}
/>
```
